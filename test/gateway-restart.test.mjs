// Issue #261: LiteLLM's exception mapping raised out of the request handler on
// an upstream 429 and the proxy exited 1. start.mjs raced every child's exit,
// so that single bad response took the router and all three forwarders down and
// every client saw a bare "Connection error" from then on.
//
// The gateway here is a stand-in that answers the liveliness probe and exits 1
// when asked, which is the only part of LiteLLM's behaviour this has to
// reproduce -- the defect was never in what killed the gateway, it was in what
// the service did afterwards.
//
// It is reached through a launcher rather than directly because the real
// `MODEL_ROUTER_LITELLM_BIN` is a launcher: `.venv/bin/litellm` on POSIX and
// `.venv\Scripts\litellm.exe` on Windows. A `.cmd` is the closest a test can
// get to the second without shipping a PE binary, and Node refuses to spawn one
// without a shell (CVE-2024-27980) -- which is exactly the gap
// `spawnableCommand` closes in `start.mjs`, so exercising it here is the point
// rather than an accident.
