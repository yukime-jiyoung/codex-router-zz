// Reserving a port by binding :0, reading the number, and closing the socket
// hands that number straight back to the ephemeral pool -- and whatever is
// meant to use it does not bind for another few milliseconds. `node --test`
// runs every test file in its own process, in parallel, so a second file's
// bind(0) could be handed the same number inside that window and whichever
// bound second died:
//
//     Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 127.0.0.1:35011
//
// It failed CI at random, most often in startup-cleanup.test.mjs, which
// reserves five ports before it spawns anything and so holds five of those
// windows open at once. Eight test files had their own copy of the same helper.
//
// The fix is to stop drawing from the pool everything else draws from. Each
// test file gets a block of ports of its own, and the blocks sit *below* every
// platform's ephemeral range (Linux from 32768, macOS and Windows from 49152),
// so no other process's bind(0) can be handed one of ours and no other test
// file using this helper shares a block. What remains is a leftover from an
// earlier run of the same file, which the bind check catches by moving up the
// block.
//
// Nothing here serializes: the blocks are disjoint by construction, so no test
// file ever waits on another.
// Keep the pool comfortably above the privileged/system-service range while
// leaving enough non-ephemeral space for large integration files. The routing
// suite now needs 75 distinct listeners; starting at 20,000 divided the range
// into only 74 ports once the Control Center tests were added.
