# Model Router installation instructions

## Repository maintenance workflow

- Use `$repo-maintainer` for incoming-change adoption decisions and consequential
  maintenance that can cross modules, clients, operating systems, installers,
  providers, credentials, protocols, generated artifacts, or release surfaces.
- Use its impact analysis and risk-proportional verification before calling such
  work complete. Skip it for factual replies and obviously isolated trivial
  edits.

These instructions apply when a user asks an agent to install this repository.

## Choose the target

- `codex` (the Codex CLI and desktop app), `dsh` (DeepSeek Harness), `gemini`
  (Gemini CLI), `cursor` (Cursor Agent plus Cursor App), and `claude` (Claude
  Code through the router-owned launcher), and `openclaw` (OpenClaw through a
  router-owned Responses provider) are supported
  targets. OpenCode remains a provider rather than a client target.
- Cursor is asymmetric: Cursor Agent uses the router's authenticated loopback
  Connect adapter, while retail Cursor App sends BYOK traffic through Cursor's
  servers and therefore needs an explicit stable public HTTPS tunnel to the
  router's separately keyed, app-only edge on port 4214. Never expose the main
  caller capability or the router port itself to the public Internet.
- **A target is a client, not a router.** One installation serves all of them:
  one background service, one gateway, one set of provider credentials, one
  provider selection, one set of ports. `MODEL_ROUTER_TARGET` selects which
  client's configuration a command writes. It must never fork the state
  directory, the service, or the credential store — a user who installs two
  would otherwise be asked for every API key twice and would run two gateways
  against one set of provider quotas. `ROUTER_PLANE_TARGET` in
  `src/paths.mjs` names that shared plane, and the environment aliases and the
  `/health` service name are keyed on it rather than on the client.
- Installing more than one is normal and needs no special handling: run the
  install once per target. Whichever ones are already present are republished
  whenever the routable set changes, so the clients cannot drift apart.

## Codex outcome

Install Codex Router for the current user, preserve every unrelated Codex
setting and ChatGPT authentication artifact, expose only the external providers
the user wants, verify the integration, and leave the final Codex restart to the
user.

## Codex procedure

1. Read the host platform and check for Codex, Git, Node.js 22.19+, and `uv` or
   Python 3.10+. On Windows, also verify that Windows PowerShell reports
   `FullLanguage` and permits `Add-Type`; the process-tree safety boundary fails
   closed before mutation under Constrained Language, AppLocker, or WDAC.
   Read-only checks are allowed. Do not install a package manager or system
   runtime without the user's permission.
2. Use a stable checkout: `~/.local/share/codex-router` on macOS/Linux, or
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-router` on Windows. Do not install the service from a
   temporary clone.
3. Never ask the user to paste OAuth tokens or API keys into chat, command
   arguments, logs, environment snippets, or tracked files.
4. Determine which provider IDs the user requested: `anthropic-api`,
    `kimi-oauth`, `antigravity-oauth`, `kimi-api`, `kimi-api-cn`, `deepseek`, `grok-oauth`, `grok-api`, `qwen-plan`,
    `zai-coding`, `ollama-cloud`, `minimax-token-plan`, `meta`, `clinepass`,
    `venice`, `nousresearch`, `chatgpt-web`, and/or
   `opencode-go`
   (shown to users as "opencode Go/Zen"; its `opencode-go-messages`,
   `opencode-go-responses`, and `opencode-zen` variants share its stored key
   and are enabled and disabled with it automatically; never select or toggle
   them separately. Zen ships no preselected models — curate them per user
   with `bin/curate-models opencode-zen`), and/or `commandcode`
   (shown to users as "Command Code"; its `commandcode-messages` variant
   shares its stored key and is enabled and disabled with it automatically;
   never select or toggle it separately. Command Code uses its stored or
   environment API key; it has no router-managed CLI sign-in path. The
   catalog-only providers `groq`, `together`, `fireworks`,
   `cerebras`, `mistral`, `nvidia-nim`, `siliconflow`, `huggingface`,
   `gemini-api`, `github-copilot`, `chutes`, and `orca` are also selectable, but they ship no
   preselected models: after
   the credential is stored, the user must run `bin/curate-models PROVIDER` in an
   interactive terminal to choose models. If they did not specify and
   credentials already exist, use
   `configured` rather than showing providers that cannot authenticate.
   `openrouter`, `venice`, and `nousresearch` also ship live-reviewed checked-in
   presets, so their picker is not empty after the key is stored; anything else
   on their current account catalogs still has to be curated.
   `venice` and `nousresearch` are ordinary API-key providers — Venice keys come
   from venice.ai/settings/api and Nous Portal keys from
   portal.nousresearch.com; neither has a router-managed CLI sign-in path, and
   Venice carries a `planNote` because a free Venice account has no API
   entitlement at all.
   The anonymous providers `opencode-free` and `kilo-free` are also selectable
   (`opencode-free-responses` is an internal, single-model protocol variant of
   the former and is never selected or curated separately),
   but they need no credential only for their documented free model subsets.
   `kilo-free` and `opencode-free` are catalog-only and need
   `bin/curate-models PROVIDER` after selection. `custom` is selectable on the
   same terms and is a container whose models each name their own endpoint, so
   enabling it asks for nothing and curating it is unnecessary. All three must
   be selected explicitly; never select one on the user's behalf just because
   it can authenticate without a key.
   `chatgpt-web` is also explicit and catalog-only, but local: it requires the
   separately installed codex-chatgpt-web launcher, an in-launcher ChatGPT
   sign-in, its browser smoke test, and `bin/curate-models chatgpt-web`. Never
   run that launcher's Install models action, because Codex Router alone owns
   `openai_base_url`; leave the launcher running as the loopback browser
   sidecar. It is Codex-only and must not be published into DSH or Gemini.
   `kimi-api` and `kimi-api-cn` are two different Moonshot platforms, not a
   fallback pair: the global console at platform.moonshot.ai and the mainland
   one at platform.moonshot.cn have separate accounts, separate billing, and
   keys that each host rejects from the other. Ask which platform the user's
   key came from rather than defaulting, and never copy a stored key between
   the two.
5. For Kimi OAuth, reuse a valid `kimi login` session. If login is needed, run
   the official CLI only in an interactive terminal. For API providers, invoke
   `bin/model-router codex provider-key PROVIDER set` in a PTY so the hidden
   prompt receives the value directly; do not relay it through chat. GitHub
   Copilot requires a fine-grained PAT with the Copilot Requests permission;
   never read or copy the official Copilot CLI credential store. Command
   Command Code is API-key-only: invoke `bin/model-router codex provider-key
    commandcode set` in a PTY so the hidden prompt receives the value directly.
   For Antigravity OAuth, never read or reuse the official `agy`/IDE credential
   store and never use the vendor's OAuth client or identity. Require one
   coherent operator-owned Google OAuth client ID and secret pair: the operator
   must create a Google OAuth **Desktop app** client they own. **The Google
   Cloud project behind that OAuth client must be allowlisted for
   `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`, a private Google API.** Most projects are not
   allowlisted, and operators cannot enable this API themselves: it requires
   the producer-side `servicemanagement.services.bind` permission.
   Run `bin/model-router codex providers login antigravity-oauth`; the router
   first binds `127.0.0.1` on an OS-assigned port, then opens a loopback-only
   setup page where the client ID and matching secret are submitted without
   entering shell history. Open only the local URL through the OS browser
   command and redirect to Google inside that listener, so neither client value
   reaches argv or terminal logs. The coherent pair and resulting tokens are
   stored together in the router's owner-only credential file and used for
   refresh on macOS, Linux, and Windows; they never belong in a service
   environment. Sign-in does not call the private Antigravity service or enable
   the route. Run the explicitly quota-consuming
   `providers probe antigravity-oauth --live --yes` next; add
   `--provision-project` only when the operator separately authorizes creation
   of a Google Cloud project. The live probe will fail with `SERVICE_DISABLED`
   if the OAuth client's project is not allowlisted. Provisioning still
   requires a successful, schema-valid bootstrap response that explicitly
   advertises the selected tier; auth errors, server errors, malformed
   responses, and missing tiers fail closed. The probe identifies itself
   truthfully as Codex Router, and only a successful proof makes the provider
   enableable. The Antigravity forwarder is not spawned or health-gated before
   that proof, so an unused provider port cannot fail the whole router. A
   passing probe records a generation-bound `pending_activation` that every
   configured and publication reader rejects. Startup alone may boot its exact
   pending proof; only after the whole local stack is healthy does it
   atomically promote that generation active. A failed restart, an early
   process death, a credential replacement, or a disconnect leaves it
   nonpublishable. The probe restarts an installed service through that
   sequence, and a foreground operator must restart that process before
   enabling the provider. A v2 proof record with no activation metadata is not
   grandfathered: it was written by the unsafe pre-readiness path and must pass
   the explicit live probe again. If Google accepts only an impersonated vendor
   client, leave it disabled. If the project is not allowlisted, this provider
   cannot currently be used.
   A key does not mean every account may use the Provider API: the Go plan is
   refused with "Your Go plan doesn't include API access". GOAT, Pro, Max, Team,
   and Provider plans do have API access and meter against their own credits.
   Say so rather than re-running setup, which cannot change an entitlement.
   Never ask for the key in chat or place it in command
   arguments, logs, environment snippets, or tracked files.
6. Run read-only legacy detection. It is safe to pass `--migrate-known` when the
   detector identifies a repository-recognized older Codex Router: migration is
   scoped, snapshotted, and reversible. Never migrate, stop, delete, or replace
   an unknown router automatically.
7. On macOS/Linux, run
   `./install.sh --target codex --auto --providers IDS --migrate-known` from the
   stable checkout. On Windows, run
   `./install.ps1 -Target codex -Auto -Providers IDS -MigrateKnown`. Omit the
   migration flag when detection found nothing. Do not enable the smoke test
   unless the user agrees to a quota-consuming request.
8. Run `bin/model-router codex doctor` (or
   `./model-router.ps1 codex doctor` on Windows). Core config, config privacy,
   catalog, caller capability, internal key, service, router health, and
   selected credentials must be `OK`. Unselected credentials may be `WARN`.
9. If a managed layer fails, use `model-router codex doctor --fix`; add
   `--migrate-known` only for a recognized older installation. Repair rebuilds
   the Node and Python dependencies unconditionally, unlike a normal install or
   update, which skips whichever dependency step already matches its
   fingerprint. Force that rebuild by hand with `bin/install --force-deps`
   (`./install.ps1 -CheckoutInstall -ForceDeps`) when an environment looks
   corrupted rather than merely out of date. If repair still fails, create
   `bin/support-bundle` and report its path without uploading it.
10. Do not terminate Codex. Tell the user to fully quit it, reopen it, create a
    new task, and choose the new model.

## DeepSeek Harness outcome

Publish the router's routed models into DeepSeek Harness as one provider route,
preserve every other section, route, comment, and credential in the harness's
own documents, and leave the harness running — it hot-reloads, so there is
nothing to restart and nothing to tell the user to quit.

## DeepSeek Harness procedure

1. Steps 1-6 of the Codex procedure apply unchanged, except that Codex itself is
   not a prerequisite: a harness-only machine needs Node 22.19+, `uv` or Python
   3.10+, and the harness. Do not run `src/catalog.mjs` there — it asks the
   Codex CLI whether the session is signed in and refuses to publish when it
   cannot ask, which is a failure, not a fallback.
2. Run `./install.sh --target dsh --auto --providers IDS` (macOS/Linux) or
   `./install.ps1 -Target dsh -Auto -Providers IDS` (Windows).
   `--migrate-known` and `--adopt-native-catalog` are refused here: both act on
   Codex's own configuration, and the harness has no counterpart to either.
3. Run `bin/model-router dsh doctor`. "Harness routing config", "Harness caller
   credential", "Harness settings privacy", and "Harness catalog freshness"
   must be `OK`, alongside the shared-plane checks.
4. Do not tell the user to restart the harness. `dsh-settings-file` watches the
   document and publishes external edits, so the route is live on the next
   request. Saying otherwise trains people to restart for nothing.

## Gemini CLI outcome

Publish the router's routed models into Gemini CLI by writing one marker block
in the environment file it already reads, preserve every other line in that
file, never open its `settings.json` for writing, and leave the user's next
`gemini` run to pick the change up.

## Gemini CLI procedure

1. Steps 1-6 of the Codex procedure apply unchanged, except that Codex itself is
   not a prerequisite: a Gemini-only machine needs Node 22.19+, `uv` or Python
   3.10+, and the `gemini` CLI. Do not run `src/catalog.mjs` there, for the same
   reason the harness does not.
2. Run `./install.sh --target gemini --auto --providers IDS` (macOS/Linux) or
   `./install.ps1 -Target gemini -Auto -Providers IDS` (Windows).
   `--migrate-known` and `--adopt-native-catalog` are refused here: both act on
   Codex's own configuration.
3. Run `bin/model-router gemini doctor`. "Gemini routing config", "Gemini
   environment conflicts", "Gemini environment privacy", and "Gemini default
   model" must be `OK`, alongside the shared-plane checks.
4. Do not tell the user to quit anything. Gemini CLI reads its environment once,
   at process start, so the next `gemini` invocation has the new values. Tell
   them instead to choose "Use Gemini API key" if the CLI asks how to
   authenticate — that is a one-time choice the CLI saves for itself, and the
   key it will use is this router's local caller capability, not a Google one.

## Cursor outcome

Publish every selected, credentialed routed model to Cursor Agent and Cursor
App without exposing the main router capability, preserve unrelated Cursor
settings, and leave Cursor stopped so the user can reopen it cleanly.

## Cursor procedure

1. Steps 1-6 of the Codex procedure apply, except that Cursor App and/or the
   official `cursor-agent` binary replace Codex as the client prerequisite.
2. Require an explicit stable public HTTPS origin for Cursor App. It must be a
   user-owned named tunnel (or equivalent) forwarding only to
   `127.0.0.1:4214`; never accept a temporary quick-tunnel URL and never point
   it at the main router port. Do not create DNS, tunnel, or cloud credentials
   without the user's authority.
3. Fully quit Cursor before writing its settings database. Run
   `./install.sh --target cursor --auto --providers IDS
   --cursor-public-url https://HOST` on macOS/Linux or
   `./install.ps1 -Target cursor -Auto -Providers IDS
   -CursorPublicUrl https://HOST` on Windows. The manager refuses a live Cursor
   process because the app can overwrite external SQLite changes on exit.
4. Run `bin/model-router cursor doctor`. The Cursor app routing config, Agent
   launcher, catalog freshness, caller capability, separate public-edge key,
   service, router health, and selected credentials must be `OK`.
5. Tell the user to run `cursor-router-agent` for Cursor Agent and to reopen
   Cursor App and choose a `codex_router/readable_name__digest/effort` model.
   The neutralized name avoids Cursor's built-in-substring BYOK rejection, and
   the suffix is how the user changes effort because Cursor gives ordinary
   user-added models no native parameter controls. The app override is global,
   so they should turn it off before returning to Cursor-managed models.
6. Cursor Agent text turns and its local read, shell, edit, and write loop are
   supported. The adapter sends typed controlled-exec messages back to the
   official client, which performs the operation under Cursor's own permission
   mode, then returns the typed result before the model resumes. Never execute
   those operations inside the router or bypass Cursor's permissions. Cursor
   MCP tools use a separate exec shape and stay unadvertised until it has the
   same official-client proof.

## Claude Code outcome

Publish every selected, credentialed routed model to Claude Code through a
router-owned `claude-router` launcher, preserve Claude's settings and login,
and keep every turn on the shared canonical Responses path.

1. Require the official `claude` CLI. Never edit `~/.claude/settings.json`.
2. Run `./install.sh --target claude --auto --providers IDS` on macOS/Linux or
   `./install.ps1 -Target claude -Auto -Providers IDS` on Windows.
3. The launcher supplies a secret-bearing loopback `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
   `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, and gateway model discovery only to its child
   process. It must not persist those values into Claude-owned files.
4. Model discovery publishes every routed slug as
   `codex_router/anthropic/ROUTER_SLUG`. The `anthropic` segment is required:
   Claude Code filters gateway-discovered ids that do not contain `claude` or
   `anthropic`.
5. The Anthropic Messages surface translates and re-enters `/v1/responses`; it
   never reaches a provider directly. Tool use/results, images, token counting,
   SSE pings, and the model list are part of the compatibility boundary.
6. Run `bin/model-router claude doctor`. Routing config, launcher, catalog
   freshness, caller capability, service, router health, and credentials must
   be `OK`. Then tell the user to run `claude-router` and use `/model`.
7. Anthropic officially supports Claude Code gateways for Claude models. Using
   non-Claude models through this compatibility surface is functional but not
   an Anthropic-supported product configuration; do not describe it otherwise.

## OpenClaw outcome

Install OpenClaw when it is missing, publish every selected and credentialed
routed model under one router-owned `codex-router` provider, preserve all other
OpenClaw configuration, and leave the next agent run to read the new route.

1. OpenClaw's current releases require Node 22.22.3+, 24.15+, 25.9+, or 26+;
   Node 23 is unsupported. The target installer must refuse an unsupported
   runtime before invoking npm. With npm 11.16+ or 12+, install the official
   package as `npm install -g openclaw@latest --allow-scripts=openclaw`; older
   npm 11 releases omit the scoped lifecycle flag they do not understand.
2. Run `./install.sh --target openclaw --auto --providers IDS` on macOS/Linux
   or `./install.ps1 -Target openclaw -Auto -Providers IDS` on Windows. The
   Control Center Harness action calls the same install-if-missing and publish
   sequence. Do not start onboarding, a gateway, or an agent as a setup side
   effect.
3. Own exactly `models.providers.codex-router`. Write it through `openclaw
   config patch --stdin --replace-path models.providers.codex-router`; never
   put the caller capability in argv, logs, or status output. Refuse a
   pre-existing provider with that id when no router publication marker proves
   ownership, or when its base URL is not a managed loopback caller URL.
4. Publish router slugs as `codex-router/SLUG` over `openai-responses`, with
   each model's context window, input modalities, and exact supported reasoning
   efforts. If no OpenClaw default exists on the first publish, set the
   highest-priority route and record ownership. Preserve any existing default,
   stop owning a default the user changes, and remove it on uninstall only
   while it still equals the router-owned value.
5. The caller URL and API key are local capabilities and make both the
   OpenClaw config and `openclaw-models.json` private state. Caller-key rotation
   must republish OpenClaw inside the same transaction as other credentialed
   clients. Status, doctor, errors, and support material must redact the URL.
6. Run `bin/model-router openclaw doctor`. OpenClaw routing config, CLI,
   config privacy, catalog freshness, caller capability, service, router
   health, and selected credentials must be `OK`.
7. AgentHarnessV2 is OpenClaw's native runtime-plugin boundary, not another
   HTTP provider protocol. A normal Responses endpoint belongs in the provider
   catalog and uses OpenClaw's embedded runtime when no native plugin claims
   it. Do not register a harness plugin or describe this integration as a
   native V2 harness. No restart is needed; tell the user to run `openclaw`.

## What the Gemini integration writes, and what it must never touch

Gemini CLI speaks only the Gemini API, so it is the one client that cannot be
pointed at `/v1/responses`. Everything below exists so that fact costs one
translation layer and nothing else.

1. **One file, three keys, and no `settings.json`.** The router owns
   `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `GEMINI_MODEL` inside a
   `# BEGIN codex-router-gemini` block in `~/.gemini/.env` (`GEMINI_HOME` in
   `paths.mjs`, which honours the CLI's own `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` override). That is the whole
   integration: `createContentGenerator` in `@google/gemini-cli-core` builds a
   plain `@google/genai` client from those variables, so nothing else has to be
   configured. Its `settings.json` is JSONC carrying the user's own comments and
   is never opened for writing — a `JSON.parse`/`stringify` round trip there
   deletes every one of them. Publishing twice is byte-identical, removing the
   block restores the document exactly, and `test/gemini-env.test.mjs` asserts
   both against a document with somebody else's work around ours.
2. **Refuse rather than guess.** `dotenv` lets the last assignment of a key in a
   file win, so a `GEMINI_API_KEY=` below our block silently decides the
   credential and nothing in the file says so. `conflictingAssignments()` finds
   any managed key assigned outside the block and the publish stops with the
   line named and the file untouched. Damaged markers — a missing end, a second
   begin — are refused the same way. Never add a "best effort" path there.
3. **The document is private.** It carries the caller key and the managed base
   URL, so it is written 0600. `~/.gemini` is created 0700 when absent and
   deliberately *not* re-moded when present: that directory is Gemini CLI's, and
   `protectPrivateFile` on a directory would strip its execute bit and break the
   CLI outright. Status output reports the redacted URL, never the whole one.
4. **`gemini` is a leaf of the caller capability, like `v1` and `panel`.** The
   SDK appends `/v1beta/models/{model}:{method}` to whatever base URL it is
   given, so the secret has to sit in the path ahead of it. A new leaf must be
   added to `redactCallerUrl` at the same time it is added to the router, or the
   caller key reaches doctor output and support bundles in the clear.
5. **The surface translates and re-enters; it never reaches a provider.**
   `gemini-surface.mjs` converts a Gemini request into a Responses request,
   sends it through the router's own `/v1/responses` over the loopback, and
   converts the answer back. That is what keeps the harness rule intact in
   spirit: tool-result ageing, the vision bridge, prompt-token substitution,
   upstream retry, model failover, and usage accounting all still sit on one
   request path. Do not give this surface its own upstream.
6. **The loopback carries no credential.** The key the CLI presents *is* this
   router's caller capability, and the path it presented it on is already the
   proof. Relaying it upstream would put a router secret on a hop that can be
   substituted onto a provider — and leaving the header off is also what makes
   `callerBroughtNoUpstreamCredential` true, which is how a client with no
   ChatGPT session of its own reaches native models after the user explicitly
   authorizes the shared router plane once.
7. **The default model is written, and that is deliberate.** Gemini CLI's own
   default is `gemini-2.5-pro`, which this router does not route, so an install
   that left it alone would 404 on the user's first turn. `GEMINI_MODEL`
   out-ranks `settings.json`'s `model.name` and is out-ranked by `--model`;
   `--no-default-model` turns it off. This is the one place the Gemini
   integration deliberately departs from the harness's opt-in rule, because
   there the default is a convenience and here it is the difference between a
   working install and a broken one.
8. **`embedContent` is refused, not faked.** The separate OpenAI-compatible
   `/v1/embeddings` surface is model-gated and is not a Gemini translation
   contract. Gemini CLI calls `embedContent` only from `baseLlmClient`, never
   from the turn loop, so a named 501 is the honest answer and a fabricated
   vector would be the dishonest one.
9. **`countTokens` is estimated.** There is no upstream to ask, and spending a
   real turn to answer a count would bill the user for a question they asked for
   free. A client that gets no number cannot decide whether to compact, so the
   same byte-ratio estimate `response-usage.mjs` uses for prompt accounting is
   the better failure.
10. **The model list is served live, so it cannot drift.**
    `/gemini/v1beta/models` reads the catalog the router already publishes,
    which is why this integration has no copy to keep in step. The published
    *default model* is a snapshot and can drift; `gemini-models.json` records
    it, doctor compares it against the routable set, and it is the marker that
    decides whether the integration is installed.
11. **A tool schema arrives as `parametersJsonSchema`, not `parameters`.**
    `tools.js` in `@google/gemini-cli-core` writes every built-in tool's schema
    into that field and validates incoming calls against the same one. Reading
    only `parameters` — the older Schema-proto spelling, which the type also
    permits — sent all ten tools upstream with no schema at all: the model
    invented argument names and the CLI rejected each call with "params must
    have required property 'file_path'". Every test passed while that was true,
    because a fixture written from the type definition spells it the other way.
    A declaration with neither field is sent as `{type: "object", properties:
    {}}` rather than with `parameters` omitted, because a chat-completions
    provider refuses a function whose parameters are absent.
12. **Verify against the real CLI, not against the docs.** Google's own
    documentation does not describe this configuration; the contract was read
    out of the installed `@google/genai` and `@google/gemini-cli-core` bundles
    (`GOOGLE_AI_API_DEFAULT_VERSION`, `formatMap('{model}:streamGenerateContent
    ?alt=sse')`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY_HEADER`, `resolveModel`'s pass-through default)
    and then proved by driving `gemini -p` at the surface. A change to the wire
    shape needs that same proof, not a plausible reading.

## What the harness integration writes, and what it must never touch

The router owns exactly two keys, in two documents that belong to the harness.
Both are hot-reloaded by it, and its own Models page writes provider routes
beside ours, so everything else in them is somebody else's work.

1. **One route, not a section.** The router owns
   `llm-pi-ai.providers.codex-router` in `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` and
   `CODEX_ROUTER_CALLER_KEY` in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`. It never reads,
   rewrites, or removes a sibling route, another adapter's section, or another
   credential. Publishing twice is byte-identical, and removing the route
   restores the document exactly — including the user's comments and blank
   lines. `test/dsh-config-manager.test.mjs` asserts both properties against a
   document that has work of somebody else's in every position the router
   writes near; do not weaken them.
   The credentials document comes in two shapes: current harness builds wrap
   the reference map in a `version`/`refs` envelope, older ones kept it at the
   document root. Both are written in place and neither is converted into the
   other, because the shape belongs to the harness build that reads the file.
   `refs` present settles it; `version` without `refs` settles it the other
   way, since that is a current harness on its first install — the case where
   guessing wrong is silent, because the harness resolves `apiKeyEnv` under
   `refs` and a key one level too high 401s with no diagnostic. `status()`
   resolves the credential through that same decision, so it can never report
   one the harness cannot read, and a new reference takes its indentation from
   a sibling rather than from the `refs:` key's own column — a mixed-indent
   block is not YAML any parser reads back, and this file holds every adapter's
   key.
2. **Refuse rather than guess.** `src/yaml-structure.mjs` is a fail-closed
   structural lexer for block-mapping YAML, not a general YAML parser. A
   document it cannot read plainly — a tab indent, a multi-document stream, a
   duplicate key, a sequence root, an unterminated flow collection, an anchored
   key, an inline `providers` mapping — is refused with the file untouched and
   the line named. A refusal costs a command; a wrong guess rewrites a file
   whose only copy is on the user's disk. Never add a "best effort" path there.
3. **Both documents are private.** The settings document carries the managed
   base URL, which is a local caller capability, and the credentials document
   carries the key it references. Both are written 0600 under a 0700 directory,
   the same bound the harness itself holds them to, and status output reports
   the redacted URL exactly as the Codex manager does. Never print the complete
   managed base URL.
4. **Routed models are always published; native ones require authorization and
   a session.** Publish only the selected, credentialed, listed, non-hidden routed
   models. An unregistered slug on the router's `/v1/responses` endpoint is
   treated as native GPT traffic needing a ChatGPT session, which a harness
   request does not carry — so a native model is advertised only while the user
   has explicitly authorized this shared local router plane and
   `nativeSessionStatus().usable` reports the session this machine is signed in
   with as spendable. `nativeSessionAvailable()` is the combined gate. Missing
   consent, an unreadable consent marker, sign-out, or expiry withholds the model.
   Publishing one the router cannot authorize offers a turn that 401s, which is
   the failure this gate exists to prevent; never widen it to presence alone,
   because an expired session is present.
   The vision-bridge engine candidates still exclude native models: that call
   site admits an engine on evidence the *caller's* session can spend it, and a
   substituted session is not the caller's.
5. **The protocol is `openai-responses`**, because that is the only thing the
   router's caller endpoint serves, and every router capability — tool-result
   ageing, the vision bridge, prompt-token substitution, upstream retry, usage
   and throughput accounting — already sits on that routed path. Do not add a
   second upstream path or a chat-completions surface for the harness; the
   point of pointing it at the same endpoint Codex uses is that there is one
   request path to keep correct. The Gemini surface is not an exception to this:
   it speaks Gemini at the edge because its client can speak nothing else, and
   then re-enters this same endpoint over the loopback rather than reaching a
   provider of its own. `models[].id` is the router **slug**, never
   the gateway model id: `/v1/responses` resolves it against `MODEL_BY_SLUG`,
   and a gateway id falls through to the native path.
6. **No `compat` on the route.** pi-ai types its reasoning-dispatch switches
   only on `openai-completions` and refuses a route-level switch anywhere else.
   Each model's request profile is applied on the router's own side of the hop,
   which is where that knowledge belongs.
7. **A reasoning level pi-ai cannot name is dropped, not approximated.** Its
   level set is `off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max`; the Codex ladder
   also spells `ultra`. `unmappableEfforts()` reports what was dropped so the
   omission is visible rather than silent. A model with no levels declares
   `reasoningEfforts: false` — omitting the field would inherit whatever
   pi-ai's installed catalog says about a colliding id.
8. **The default model is the user's.** Taking over `agent-default-model` is
   opt-in (`--set-default-model`), snapshotted verbatim, and restored on
   uninstall — the same discipline the Codex login-free mode applies to `model`
   and `model_provider`. Never write it as a side effect of publishing.
9. **Delegation is composition, not settings.** `dsh-tool-subagent` installs no
   settings section, so the router cannot configure the harness's subagent
   model and must not edit a preset it does not own. A child with no model of
   its own inherits the default model selection, which is already a routed
   model once the route is the default;
   `./bin/model-router dsh subagent-preset` prints the block to paste for a
   deployment that wants children on a *different* routed model. Codex's
   `bin/multi-agent` stays Codex-only: it drives `multi_agent_version` and the
   Codex agents directory, whose payloads are Codex's own encrypted format.
10. **Drift is this integration's failure mode.** The harness hot-reloads its
    settings document, so anything else that writes it takes effect at once and
    can leave the published route naming models the gateway no longer routes.
    `dsh-models.json` in the router's own state directory records what the last
    publish wrote; doctor compares it against the routable set, and it is the
    marker that decides whether an integration is installed. Any code path that
    changes the routable set must republish through
    `refreshTargetPickerIfInstalled()`, which refreshes every installed client
    rather than only the active target.

## The Python gateway is installed from a hash-verified lock

The router's gateway is LiteLLM, so every install executes a large Python
dependency tree. That tree is pinned and hashed rather than re-resolved.

1. `requirements/python.txt` is the lock: the full transitive closure of
   `PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS` in `src/install-plan.mjs`, every distribution pinned
   and carrying its SHA256. Both installers install *that file* with
   `--require-hashes`, in both their `uv` and their `pip` branch. Pinning only
   the two top-level packages left everything underneath them floating, which
   is how one machine's gateway came to differ from another's.
2. Never edit either `requirements/` file by hand, and never add a package to
   an installer command line. Change the pin in `src/install-plan.mjs` and run
   `bin/lock-python`, which rewrites `requirements/python.in` from
   `PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS` and recompiles the lock. Commit both files together.
3. The lock must stay **universal**. `bin/lock-python` passes `--universal
   --generate-hashes --python-version 3.10`, which is what makes one file
   serve macOS, Linux, and Windows on CPython 3.10+ through environment
   markers. A lock regenerated without `--universal` looks fine and installs
   only on the machine that produced it; `test/python-lock.test.mjs` fails on
   that, on an unhashed entry, and on any disagreement with
   `PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS`. Do not weaken those tests to land a lock.
4. Check which wheels a litellm pin actually publishes before moving it.
   `1.95.0` shipped `manylinux` and `win_amd64` only, so **macOS built it from
   the sdist** with `maturin` and a Rust toolchain — slow, and broken outright
   without `cargo`. `1.96.0` publishes macOS wheels (arm64 and x86_64) as well,
   so no supported platform builds from source today. If a macOS install is slow
   or failing, check for `cargo` and check the pin's wheel list; do not assume
   either state.
5. Hash verification covers the distributions, not the isolated build
   environment pip and uv create for an sdist. `maturin` is fetched unhashed
   during that build. Closing that gap needs a separate build-requirements
   lock; do not claim the current lock covers it. No supported platform builds
   from source at the current pin, which narrows the exposure but does not
   remove it — a pin without a wheel for someone's platform brings it back.
6. A pin can be a **security floor**, and moving it backwards reintroduces the
   advisory it was raised for. `litellm==1.95.0` required
   `cryptography>=48.0.1,<49.0`, so no patched cryptography could be resolved
   while it was held (GHSA-g6cj-pr64-35w5, fixed in 50.0.0). Dependabot reports
   the transitive package; the fix is almost always the direct pin above it.
7. Resolving is not booting. litellm's own metadata allows fastapi versions its
   code cannot import (`get_flat_dependant`, removed in 0.140), so `uv pip
   compile` will happily produce a lock whose gateway dies on startup. Any
   change to either Python pin has to be proven by starting the proxy and
   getting a live `/health/liveliness`, not by a successful resolve.
8. The lock is proven by installing it, not by reasoning about it.
   `.github/workflows/python-lock.yml` installs it for real on Linux and
   Windows through both resolvers, then asserts the pinned versions, the
   `litellm[proxy]` extra, and a live `/health/liveliness`. It gets the command
   from `install-plan.mjs python-install-command`, which extracts the line from
   `bin/install` and `install.ps1` themselves — never write a `pip install` line
   into CI, because a job that spells its own command can pass while the
   shipped installer fails. Its negative control must also keep failing: if an
   unhashed requirement ever installs, every other check in that job is
   meaningless. Do not add a resolver cache there; a cache hit can serve an
   already-unpacked wheel and skip the hash check the job exists to perform.

## `stop` and `start` act on the same layer, and the proxy survives either

`bin/stop` unloads the background service. `bin/start` used to exec the
supervisor in the foreground instead, so the obvious `stop; start` pair was
asymmetric: it retired the managed service and left an unmanaged copy in its
place. The copy carried the calling shell's environment rather than the
installed one and died with the shell that started it.

That is how a live installation lost its proxy. A `stop; start` issued from a
`zsh -lc` that a desktop app had spawned produced a router with no
`HTTP_PROXY` and no `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY`, because the shell had neither. Every
upstream was dialled directly, chatgpt.com timed out, and the router answered
502 with the message from `src/transport-failure.mjs` telling the operator to
set an opt-in that was already set -- in the LaunchAgent it had just unloaded.
The service definition still looked correct at every glance.

1. **Both verbs go through `src/service.mjs`.** `bin/start`, Windows
   `codex-router.ps1 start`, and their corresponding stop paths manage the same
   background-service layer. Never add a lifecycle verb that manages the service
   on one side and bypasses it on the other.
2. **The foreground supervisor stays reachable, never by accident.**
   `bin/start --foreground` and `codex-router.ps1 start --foreground` are the
   explicit debugging paths. They enter through `src/foreground-start.mjs`,
   which holds the shared service-operation lock for the supervisor's lifetime.
   That keeps caller-capability rotation/recovery from swapping generations
   underneath an unmanaged foreground router. Direct `src/start.mjs` remains the
   OS-service payload; do not route the managed service through the lifetime lock.
3. **A silent environment adopts the recorded proxy.**
   `inheritedProxyEnvironment()` in `src/proxy-environment.mjs` reads the
   install manifest, and `src/start.mjs` applies it to `process.env` before it
   reads anything or spawns a child, so the router and all three forwarders
   inherit it. This is the belt to the service definition's braces: it makes
   the foreground path, and any future path that execs the supervisor directly,
   reach upstreams exactly as the managed one does.
4. **Silence is the only trigger.** `proxyEnvironmentDeclared` already treats a
   named proxy -- or any `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY`, `0` included -- as the operator
   speaking, and the restore defers to it. A deliberate unproxied run stays
   unproxied. Do not widen the trigger to "no proxy reachable" or similar
   inference; the manifest records a decision, not a guess.
5. **Coverage.** `test/proxy-environment.test.mjs` holds the restore contract
   and `test/service-lifecycle.test.mjs` holds the dispatch/ownership boundary:
   normal start reaches the managed service layer, Windows matches POSIX, and
   explicit foreground startup cannot boot while another service lifecycle
   operation owns the shared lock. The same file keeps the silent-environment
   proxy restore regression.

## The gateway is restarted in place; the router is not taken down with it

`src/gateway-supervisor.mjs` watches the LiteLLM child and replaces it when it
dies. It exists because the gateway is the one child of the service that is not
ours: a bug anywhere in that pinned Python tree can end the process rather than
the request, and issue #261 is exactly that — mapping an upstream 429 raised out
of LiteLLM's own request handler and the proxy exited 1. `start.mjs` raced every
child's exit, so one failed request killed the router and all three forwarders
and every client saw a bare "Connection error" naming nothing.

1. **Only the gateway is supervised.** The forwarders and the router are ours;
   when one of them dies the service still exits and the OS supervisor rebuilds
   it. Do not extend the supervisor to them to "be consistent" — a crash in our
   own code is a bug report, and papering over it costs the incident.
2. **Supervision starts only after the gateway has been healthy once.** A
   gateway that never came up is a dependency or configuration failure, and
   retrying it buries the message the operator needs. Startup failure is
   unchanged: it throws out of `main()` and takes the service down, which is
   what `test/startup-cleanup.test.mjs` asserts.
3. **Bounded, and bounded *in a window*.** At most five restarts inside ten
   minutes, backing off 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, capped at 30s. The window is
   load-bearing in both directions: a lifetime budget would eventually stop
   restarting an install that crashes once a month, and no bound at all turns a
   gateway that dies on every request into a spawn loop. Past the bound the
   supervisor returns and the service exits exactly as it used to, so launchd's
   `KeepAlive`, systemd's `Restart=always`, and Task Scheduler get their clean
   restart. `CODEX_ROUTER_GATEWAY_RESTARTS=0` disables it entirely and restores
   the pre-#261 behaviour, which is what a crash investigation wants.
4. **Never silent.** The production LaunchAgent hard-sets `CODEX_ROUTER_QUIET`,
   and a router that quietly resurrects a crashing gateway is indistinguishable
   from one that never failed. Every crash, every restart, and the decision to
   stop restarting are logged unconditionally.
5. **A replacement that never becomes healthy is stopped, not left parked.**
   Otherwise the loop waits on an exit that only an external kill can produce,
   and a hung gateway looks like a healthy one.
6. **`/health` names the unreachable dependency.** The unauthenticated leaf
   carries `degraded: ["gateway"]` — a closed set of three fixed local service
   names, never a URL, a credential, or the per-service payloads the protected
   leaf carries, and `test/routing.test.mjs` asserts that boundary. It is what
   lets doctor report "serving but reports gateway unreachable" instead of "not
   ready", which sent operators looking for a dead service when the gateway was
   the thing that died.
7. **The launcher is spawned through `spawnableCommand`, like every other
   external command.** The installer produces `litellm.exe` on Windows, so the
   shipped path is untouched pass-through — but `MODEL_ROUTER_LITELLM_BIN` and
   `CODEX_ROUTER_LITELLM_BIN` are operator-set, and Node has refused to spawn a
   `.cmd`/`.bat` without a shell since CVE-2024-27980. A batch launcher there
   used to end the service before it spawned anything, with an EINVAL naming
   neither the file nor the reason. Never reintroduce a bare
   `spawn(command, args)` in `start.mjs`; `test/gateway-restart.test.mjs` guards
   the shape, because the behaviour itself cannot be exercised on POSIX. All
   three fields of the result are load-bearing, `options` included: for a batch
   shim it carries `windowsVerbatimArguments`, without which Node re-quotes a
   command line that is already escaped for cmd.exe. A call site that spreads
   only `command` and `args` is a Windows bug that POSIX CI cannot see — it was
   how `devinCliVersion` came to report "unknown" for an installed CLI. Note
   the one cost of the batch path: the service then holds the `cmd.exe` hop
   rather than the gateway, so a signal reaches the hop and the real process is
   orphaned. That is strictly better than not starting at all, and it is another
   reason the installer produces an `.exe`.
8. **Z.ai choice-bearing terminal usage is normalized before LiteLLM.** LiteLLM
   1.95/1.96 can discard authoritative usage when an OpenAI-compatible provider
   puts `finish_reason` and `usage` on the same streaming chunk. Z.ai does that,
   so `src/zai-cache-usage.mjs` rewrites only that provider shape into the
   standard usage-only terminal chunk and preserves explicit cached-token
   details. Do not replace missing usage with estimates at this boundary and do
   not downgrade LiteLLM to escape the bug; the pin is also a security and
   wheel-availability floor. `scripts/verify-zai-litellm-usage.mjs` exercises
   the pinned LiteLLM bridge with synthetic authoritative usage on every Python
   lock job.
9. **Z.ai Responses streams need a post-LiteLLM message-envelope repair.**
   Live GLM-5.3 traffic through LiteLLM 1.96 can finish a reasoning item and
   then emit `response.output_text.delta` for the assistant message without the
   required `response.output_item.added` / `response.content_part.added`
   envelope. The same malformed stream can reuse reasoning's `output_index=0`
   for the message and close the message with a `reasoning_text` content part.
   `src/zai-responses-compat.mjs` repairs only that Z.ai event-stream shape
   after LiteLLM translation: valid streams remain byte-identical, native
   OpenAI traffic is never attached to the transform, and provider reasoning
   must never be copied into assistant-visible message content. A real Codex
   live probe is the regression oracle: no `OutputTextDelta without active
   item` warnings and the message occupies the next output index after
   reasoning.
10. **LiteLLM custom-tool streaming uses a mixed lifecycle.** LiteLLM 1.96
   converts Responses `type: "custom"` tools into Chat Completions functions
   whose one required string property is `content`. On the return stream it can
   already restore `response.output_item.added` / `done` as native
   `custom_tool_call` items while still emitting legacy
   `response.function_call_arguments.delta` / `done` events whose JSON wrapper
   is `{ "content": "..." }`. `NamespaceToolCallTransform` may decode that
   wrapper only when the source opening itself was already a native custom call;
   the router's own custom-function bridge keeps its `{ "input": "..." }`
   contract. Keep the streamed-input fingerprint check and fail closed when the
   delta, terminal arguments, or output-item close disagree. The focused
   namespace-relay test and Z.ai router fixture hold both sides of this boundary.
11. **Do not answer a gateway crash by moving the litellm pin.** The pin is a
   security floor and a wheel-availability decision (see the lock section
   above), any change to it has to be proven by booting the proxy rather than by
   a successful resolve, and a router that survives its gateway is worth having
   at every version. Coverage lives in `test/gateway-supervisor.test.mjs` (the
   loop, the bound, the window, the backoff) and `test/gateway-restart.test.mjs`
   (end to end: a stand-in gateway exits 1 mid-request, the service does not,
   and the router is still serving afterwards).

## Requests to install or expose more models

First distinguish a local model addition from a repository-wide model change.
Prefer local curation when one user wants a model that an already registered
provider advertises. Change the checked-in registry only when the user intends
to ship tested support to every installer.

### Add models for the current user

1. Inspect the installed selection with
   `./bin/model-router codex providers list --json`. Do not assume that a stored
   credential means the provider is intentionally visible.
2. If authentication is missing, use the provider's official OAuth CLI or run
   `./bin/model-router codex provider-key PROVIDER set` in a PTY. Keep secrets
   out of chat, arguments, logs, environment snippets, and tracked files.
3. If the requested model is already checked into the registry tree under
   `config/` (one vendor directory holding a `<vendor>.json` provider file
   plus per-access-method `models.json` fragments, e.g.
   `config/kimi/kimi.json` and `config/kimi/oauth/models.json`), run
   `./bin/model-router codex providers enable PROVIDER`. This preserves the
   other selected providers and refreshes the installed picker catalog.
4. If the provider is registered but the model is not checked in, run
   `./bin/curate-models PROVIDER` in an interactive terminal. When the user gave
   exact IDs and the live catalog confirms them, the deterministic form is
   `./bin/curate-models PROVIDER --models ID1,ID2 --apply`. On Windows use
   `node .\src\curate-models.mjs` with the same arguments.
   OrcaRouter also supports `--free-only`, which additively curates every live
   concrete OpenAI-compatible entry whose catalog price is zero, tags it
   `isFree`, and removes the moving `orcarouter/free` meta-router if an older
   run curated it. It still requires an OrcaRouter API key for inference and
   never turns the provider on implicitly.
5. Local curation writes protected `user-models.json` state and survives router
   updates. Never edit the checked-in `config/` registry tree merely to
   satisfy one machine's
   request. The provider's own `/v1/models` endpoint alone decides which
   models exist. Interactive curation asks for each new model's context
   window, image support, and reasoning efforts (so the user can switch
   effort in the picker); the deterministic `--models` form takes
   conservative defaults, `--efforts minimal,low,medium,high,xhigh` sets the
   effort ladder, and every stored value stays editable in
   `user-models.json`. The context window is the exception to "conservative
   default": both forms store the `context_length` the provider's own catalog
   advertises for that model (`modelContextLengths` in
   `src/model-discovery.mjs`), because `autoCompact` is derived from it and an
   understated window makes Codex compact a session that had the room. Only a
   model the catalog sizes in silence falls back to 131072.
   OpenCode Zen's anonymous catalog publishes ids and nothing else, so its free
   models are sized and laddered from `src/opencode-curation.mjs`, which
   records OpenCode's own published `limit` and `reasoning_options` for each
   *free id* along with the sourcing. A documented window is stored only when
   the 0.85 auto-compact ratio still reserves that id's published
   `limit.output`; otherwise the id keeps 131072 and its description says the
   window is unknown, because a window a full-length completion can overrun
   fails the turn outright. An id OpenCode documents nothing usable for keeps
   the stock "conservative default metadata" description, which is how a
   stored entry says every value in it is a default rather than an advertised
   capability. An explicit `--efforts` always wins over a documented ladder. An entry curated
   before this landed keeps its stored window — an additive run never rewrites
   existing metadata — so repair it by editing `user-models.json` or by
   `--remove`-ing and re-curating the model. An optional `availabilityNux` string on a model becomes
   the Codex "Introducing {model}" announcement (shown a limited number of
   times per slug, tracked by the Codex client itself); leave it unset unless
   the model is genuinely news to the operator. Curated models are not
   implicitly approved as native v2 subagent model overrides.
6. A curated model inherits a request profile from the provider's registry
   models. The catalog-only resellers ship none, so curation also asks whether
   the model rejects a forced `tool_choice` (`--request-profile
   auto-tool-choice` in the deterministic form). Answer yes only for a model
   observed to answer HTTP 400 on `tool_choice: "required"` while still
   calling tools under `"auto"` — the restriction belongs to the upstream
   behind the reseller, not to the reseller, so it is set per model and never
   as a provider-wide default. Never widen it by changing what
   `src/compatibility-test.mjs` sends: the probe must keep sending `required`,
   or it stops proving tool calling works for every other provider.
7. Run `./bin/model-router codex doctor`. A live `bin/test-model` request uses
   provider quota, so run it only with the user's approval. Finally, tell the
   user to fully quit and reopen Codex before checking the picker.

If the provider itself is unknown to the registry, stop treating the request as
installation. It is repository development and requires the process below.

### Subagent capability is researched, not asserted

Switching a model on as a subagent (tray toggle, `control subagents set`) is
the operator's whole job; deciding whether that model **under that provider**
can hold the v2 child role is the router's. The same model answers differently
per provider — tool support, request profiles, and payload handling all vary —
so the unit of evidence is always the slug, never the model name.

1. Enabling an unknown model hands it to a detached compatibility probe
   (`src/subagent-verify.mjs`): two live requests through the installed router
   proving streaming and a forced tool call. The proofs snapshot shows
   `checking` until the verdict lands. A passing probe records `candidate`; it
   does **not** advertise v2. A worker that dies without a verdict records a
   failure, and a stale `checking` record is retryable. Explicit registry-v1
   routes are settled decisions and are never re-opened by this local probe;
   registry-v2 routes need no compatibility probe.
2. `multi-agent-proofs.json` is diagnostic application evidence only. Local
   `candidate`, and legacy `experimental` / `proven`, records cannot change the
   catalog's `multi_agent_version`, managed agent definitions, or any client
   route. `applySubagentProofs` deliberately returns the registry capabilities
   unchanged. An unreadable proofs file therefore authorizes and promotes
   nothing.
3. The compatibility probe is not the native collaboration proof. It does not
   exercise Codex's encrypted child payload relay, a marker-return spawn, or a
   same-thread follow-up. A successful ordinary chat/tool request must never be
   presented as evidence that the model can hold the native v2 child role.
4. Only the exact checked-in registry route may assert v2. The route's slug,
   provider, and upstream model must match an accepted artifact under
   `v2_agent/`, and the accepted artifact and `multiAgentVersion: "v2"` change
   land in the same pull request. CI enforces the implication in both
   directions for every post-workflow promotion. Six exact Kimi/Grok route
   identities certified before the artifact gate are grandfathered; changing
   any part of one identity loses that exception.
5. `control subagents verify [SLUG ...]` re-researches explicitly (foreground,
   about two requests per unknown candidate); with no slugs it sweeps the
   enabled list. Select-all and mode changes never trigger probes. Provider,
   model, and family auto-policies are explicit standing consent for matching
   newly configured unknown routes; they still produce only candidates.
6. Machine-local evidence is exactly that. Never edit checked-in `config/`
   because one machine's probe passed. Complete the redacted application,
   reproduce the two native child checks with a spendable account, and review
   the exact provider route before shipping a v2 claim to every installer.

### Ship a model to every installer

1. Run `./bin/discover-models PROVIDER`; discovery is read-only. Confirm the
   model ID and capabilities against the provider's current official
   documentation. Never infer tools, images, context size, reasoning, or billing
   behavior from the model name.
2. Add the model declaratively to the vendor's registry fragment (the
   `config/<vendor>/<method>/models.json` file for its provider; a new
   provider also needs its definition in `config/<vendor>/<vendor>.json`)
   with unique `slug`,
   `gatewayModel`, and provider/upstream IDs; complete picker metadata;
   supported reasoning levels; input modalities; context/compaction limits;
   and the correct request profile. Use `listed: false` for compatibility-only
   aliases. An optional `availabilityNux` string ships announcement copy that
   Codex renders as its "Introducing {model}" card the first few launches
   after the model appears; reserve it for a genuinely new flagship, because
   every installer will see it. Checked-in models that newly become routable
   (added by an update, or unlocked when the operator credentials and enables
   their provider) also announce automatically for seven days with copy
   assembled from their verified picker metadata (context window, effort
   ladder, image support) — tracked in the protected
   `announced-models.json` state; the first catalog capture seeds that state
   silently, curated `availabilityNux` copy wins over the generated text, and
   locally curated user models never self-announce. In the CLI TUI this renders as a startup tip
   line; the full-screen prompt is instead driven by an optional `upgradeTo`
   object (`{ "model": "target/slug", "markdown": "..." }`) on the model the
   operator currently runs: Codex renders the markdown as the entire
   "Codex just got an upgrade" modal (with `{model_from}`/`{model_to}`
   placeholders), and accepting switches the operator's default model to the
   target, so ship one only for a genuine successor.
3. A new provider also needs credential isolation, discovery metadata,
   selection/onboarding support, request translation, health behavior, and
   tests. Never place an API key or OAuth artifact in the registry. A new
   provider is not done until the whole checklist in
   "Ship a new provider to every installer" below passes.
4. Set `multiAgentVersion: "v2"` only after the model is proven through native
   Codex collaboration: tool calls work, encrypted subagent payload relay works
   without disclosure, a marker-return spawn succeeds, and a same-thread
   follow-up succeeds. Otherwise omit it and retain conservative v1 behavior.
   The registry is not the only way a route reaches v2. The operator's own
   selection promotes it — `subagents mode selected` plus `subagents set <slug>
   on`, or `mode all` — and so does a completed local verification of all five
   checks recorded in `multi-agent-proofs.json`. Selection is the ordinary path
   and the one the Control Center switch uses; the registry exists so nobody
   has to select a proven route by hand. None of this loosens the gate: an
   explicit `off` beats every mode, a hidden model is never promoted, a partial
   verification or a mismatched slug promotes nothing, the legacy diagnostic
   statuses promote nothing, and only the pull request that moves the registry
   entry may accept a `v2_agent/` application. Read
   `docs/SUBAGENT-CERTIFICATION.md` in full before changing
   `src/subagent-*.mjs`, `src/multi-agent-state.mjs`, `v2_agent/`, or the
   Subagents column — it records which questions have already been answered at
   the cost of provider quota.
5. Remember that Codex advertises only a small priority-ordered subset of native
   spawn-model overrides. Adjust priority intentionally and keep the desired
   Kimi/Grok/GPT choices in that visible subset; do not crowd them out
   accidentally when adding a model. The published catalog carries two
   numberings for exactly this reason (`publishedPickerPriorities` in
   `src/catalog.mjs`): a certified v2 route keeps its authored priority so it
   stays inside that window, while every v1 routed model is published in a
   band above the highest visible native priority so the picker shows vendor
   groups instead of interleaving routed entries among native GPT models
   (issue #544). Only the published entry is renumbered; failover, the vision
   bridge, and the other clients keep reading the registry value.
6. Add registry, catalog, routing/request-profile, and failure-path regression
   tests. Run `npm run check` and `npm test`. With explicit quota approval, run
   `./bin/test-model 'provider/model' --live --yes`, reinstall, fully restart
   Codex, and perform the native subagent probe before claiming support.

### Republish a native model at a different context window

`src/native-context-variants.mjs` publishes a native GPT model under a second
slug carrying a different context window — `gpt-5.6-sol-1m` is the first. It is
not a new model and never becomes one: the entry is copied wholesale from the
capture, the router translates the slug back to its base on the way out, and
the only fields overridden are the slug, the display name, the description, and
the window/compaction pair.

1. The window is read from the provider's current official documentation, the
   same rule as any other model. Never raise one because a request happened to
   be accepted, and never guess from the family name. `bin/doctor` reports
   windows a provider has already disproved; that check does not authorize the
   opposite direction.
2. A variant ships hidden. `seedModelsHidden` applies that default exactly once
   per slug, so it can never re-apply itself over an operator's choice — which
   is why `model-picker.json` records `seeded` alongside `hidden`, and why
   every writer in `src/model-picker-state.mjs` must preserve it. A variant
   that costs more per turn than the model it shadows must never arrive
   switched on in an update.
3. Derive only from a base the capture actually shipped as `visibility: "list"`,
   and never in a login-free install: signed-out Codex surfaces display native
   slugs from a server-supplied allowlist, so a synthesized slug would consume
   an alias slot and then be invisible.
4. Every surface that enumerates the OpenAI group goes through
   `withNativeContextVariants` — the catalog build, the tray probe, and the
   group's Show all / Hide all. A surface that reads `native-models.json`
   directly will silently omit variants. Published clients
   (`src/routed-client-models.mjs`, serving DeepSeek Harness and Gemini CLI)
   are deliberately not among them: they read the capture and do not apply the
   picker's hidden set to native models, so a variant would arrive switched on
   in a surface that has no switch. Publishing one there means fixing that
   first.
5. Cover the derivation, the slug translation on a live native turn, the
   hidden-by-default seeding, and the survival of an explicit choice across a
   rebuild. `test/native-context-variants.test.mjs` is the existing shape.

### Ship a new provider to every installer

A new provider is only complete when all of the following are true. Do not
land a provider that satisfies routing but skips the tray, install, or usage
surfaces.

1. **One-click install.** The provider ID must work end to end with no manual
   config edits: selectable through `install.sh --providers` /
   `install.ps1 -Providers`, through
   `bin/model-router codex providers enable PROVIDER`, and reported correctly
   by `bin/model-router codex doctor`. If the provider ships no preselected
   models, document it as catalog-only and make sure `bin/curate-models`
   handles it.
2. **Tray setup section.** Every provider must appear in the macOS tray with a
   working setup card driven by `src/provider-onboarding.mjs` and the control
   commands the tray invokes:
   - API-key providers get the hidden credential path (tray →
     `control credential PROVIDER` over stdin → `saveApiCredential`). The key
     must never transit chat, logs, or command arguments.
   - OAuth providers additionally get the OAuth section: an `OAUTH_CLIS`
     entry in `src/provider-onboarding.mjs` (executable, npm package, login
     arguments) so the tray's `install-cli PROVIDER` and `login PROVIDER`
     buttons work, plus status,
     session-refresh, and reconnect-on-expiry wiring in the provider's OAuth
     status/session modules (follow `kimi-oauth-*` / `grok-oauth-*` as the
     patterns).
   - Connecting is always one click. Any tray sign-in button installs the
     official CLI when it is missing and then runs the login in the same
     operation (`connectProvider` in the tray), rather than stopping after the
     install and waiting for a second click. Label the button for everything
     it will do (`Install & Sign In`) so the single click stays honest. This
     is the house rule for every provider, OAuth or CLI-session: implement it
     without asking.
   - Add the provider icon under
     `apps/macos/ModelRouterTray/Resources/` and record its source in
     `PROVIDER-ICON-SOURCES.md`.
3. **Plan entitlement.** When a provider's credential can authenticate an
   account whose plan still may not call the API, set `planNote` on its
   registry entry. `providers enable`, `doctor`, and the tray all print it, so
   the requirement is visible where someone connects instead of arriving as a
   403 inside Codex. Command Code is the case: every plan except Go is served
   through the Provider API, while Go remains CLI-only.
4. **Usage, limits, and balance in the tray.** Wire the provider's account
   endpoint into `src/provider-account-usage.mjs` so `provider-usage --json`
   returns real metrics: `quota` metrics (used/limit/remaining with reset
   time) for plan- or window-limited providers, and `balance` metrics (the
   remaining dollar or credit amount) for prepaid/pay-per-use providers. These
   feed the tray's "% left" display, usage cards, and low-remaining reminders,
   so a provider without them silently hides the user's spend. If the provider
   exposes no usage or balance API, the snapshot must degrade gracefully and
   the tray must say usage is unavailable rather than showing stale or empty
   numbers. Routed request/token accounting comes from the shared usage-events
   pipeline and needs no per-provider work beyond correct event recording.

## Vision bridge for text-only models

The router can let a text-only model answer about a pasted image: the routed
request path sends each image part to a vision-capable model the operator has
already enabled and credentialed, and substitutes the returned transcript into
the turn as text. Treat it as a router capability, never as a model capability.

1. It is **on by default** and off only when the operator says so
   (`bin/control vision-bridge off`, protected state in `vision-bridge.json`).
   Reading a pasted screenshot is the one thing people expect to work without
   finding a toggle, and everything it needs is already installed: an install
   with nothing to read images with resolves no engine and degrades exactly as
   it did before the bridge existed, so the default costs an unequipped machine
   nothing.
   - The line between "never configured" and "configured off" is **structural,
     not a sentinel**: no state file means nobody has answered and the current
     default applies; a readable file's `enabled` is the operator's own answer
     and is taken verbatim forever. A stored `false` must never be re-enabled by
     a change of default. A file that exists but this build cannot parse falls
     back to **off**, not to the default — somebody was here and we cannot tell
     what they chose, so it must not start spending quota.
   - `version` stays `1` on purpose. A bump would have to guess what an older
     `false` meant, and there is nothing to guess with; file presence already
     answers it, and `visionBridgeConfigured()` has gated exactly that
     distinction since the bridge shipped. Do not add a migration that replaces
     that fact with an inference.
   - The installer writes no bridge state at all. It used to auto-enable once
     when a vision-capable provider happened to be selected, which made the
     file's presence mean "the installer ran" and left every other install
     needing a command nobody knew about. It now only reports. Never write
     bridge state from an install or update path; a routed image spends the
     engine provider's quota, so the only writers are the operator's own
     commands.
   - Because it is on by default, a surface that would nag an unconfigured
     install checks `visionBridgeConfigured()` first. `doctor` warns about "no
     resolvable engine" only for an operator who actually asked; for a
     default-on install it reports `ok`, since nothing was lost.
2. The registry keeps declaring what each model itself reads. `inputModalities`
   is never edited to add `image` for a bridge, and `visionBridge` accepts only
   `false`, as a per-model opt-out. The registry loader rejects `true` so the
   file can never assert a capability the model lacks.
3. The catalog advertises image input on a bridged model only while an engine
   actually resolves from the selected, credentialed, listed set. When the
   bridge is off, or the pinned engine disappears, the advertisement goes with
   it — Codex gates the paste on `input_modalities`, so a stale advertisement
   would leave a paste that nothing can serve. Rebuild the catalog after every
   change and tell the user to fully quit and reopen Codex.
   `resolveVisionEngine` takes that set as a **function**, never as an array,
   and rejects an array outright. Assembling it means probing every provider's
   credential synchronously — on macOS one `/usr/bin/security` spawn per
   provider per keychain service, ~250ms with the event loop stopped — while two
   of the three answers (bridge off, engine pinned to `local`) never look at a
   candidate. On the request path that cost was paid per pasted image and
   blocked every other in-flight request. Deferring narrows nothing: what gets
   ranked is still exactly the selected, credentialed, listed set. A lazy list
   that skips the credential check is a security regression, not a speedup.
4. A registry engine's call goes through the same gateway, credential, and
   request profile as any other routed turn. Do not add a second upstream path,
   a separate vision API key, or an external CLI dependency for a hosted engine.
   The one sanctioned exception is the local engine (`vision-bridge local`): a
   vision model the operator runs themselves (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp). It
   lives outside the registry, so the request path calls its
   `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint directly with no credential, and it is used
   only when explicitly pinned — auto mode never routes images to `localhost`,
   since an unreachable server would fail every paste. The rule is about the
   address, not about that one engine: a **keyless registry provider** (`local`,
   and the loader guarantees keyless means a loopback `baseUrl`) is the same
   hazard wearing a registry slug, so `resolveVisionEngine` excludes every
   loopback-served candidate from auto and admits it only by explicit pin. It
   stays listed in the picker, because choosing it carries the knowledge that
   the server has to be up. Auto mode is the only default an unattended machine
   gets, so it may only nominate an engine that is reachable without the
   operator having started something. This is what lets a
   text-only-only install enable the bridge with no paid vision model. The
   `vision-bridge setup` command and probe target Ollama for auto-download
   because it is a managed daemon with a stable model registry — the only
   runtime where "install once and it keeps working" holds. llama.cpp and LM
   Studio remain first-class manual engines (the probe detects both, and
   `vision-bridge local <model> <baseUrl>` pins either); the installer never
   installs a runtime or pulls a multi-gigabyte model without explicit consent
   (`setup` requires `--yes` before any download). A model download runs
   detached (`src/vision-download.mjs` streams Ollama's `/api/pull` and records
   progress in `vision-download.json`): `pull` returns at once and `pull-status`
   reports the percentage, because a synchronous multi-gigabyte pull freezes
   the tray and reads as a crash. The worker pins the model only after it is on
   disk, so a failed or interrupted download never repoints the bridge at a
   model that is not there.
5. The second sanctioned exception is a **native engine**: a vision model from
   the operator's own signed-in ChatGPT plan, reached over the native path the
   router already owns (`NATIVE_BASE`) with the caller's own session headers.
   It is permitted because it introduces nothing — no stored credential, no
   separate vision API key, no external CLI, no install step, nothing to
   download — and because it spends a plan the operator already pays for, on a
   backend the router already talks to on every native turn. That is the whole
   justification. These conditions are what keep it from widening into
   something else, and each one is load-bearing:
   - **No new credential, ever.** A native engine carries the caller's session
     and nothing else: the fixed `FORWARD_HEADERS` allowlist, copied from the
     request in hand and sent only to the hardcoded `NATIVE_BASE`. The router
     must never store, cache, mint, or read a credential for this path, and the
     gateway's internal key must never travel to that backend. An engine that
     would need a key the router does not already hold is not this exception.
   - **Fail closed when there is no caller session.** No session on the request
     means no native engine: not a candidate, and a pin naming one does not
     resolve. Never fall back to the gateway for a native slug — it holds no
     credential for one — and never accept an on-disk capture as evidence that
     the session is still good. `native-models.json` and `merged-models.json`
     are both reused deliberately when a fresh probe fails, so a sign-out leaves
     them naming an engine that can no longer be called. Signing out has to stop
     the engine resolving on the very next paste, not at the next catalog
     rebuild. Cached transcripts are part of this: a native transcript is keyed
     to the account that bought it, because a cache hit skips the call and with
     it every check that this session may still spend that model.
   - **This is not a general bypass.** It licenses one destination and one
     credential: the router's own native path, on the caller's own session. It
     is not a precedent that any hosted engine may skip the gateway once its
     credential story sounds tidy. Item 4 stands unchanged for every registry
     engine — a hosted engine that would bring a second upstream, a separate
     vision key, or an external dependency goes through the gateway or does not
     ship.

   Known gap: **plan quota and limits** spent this way are still not surfaced.
   Every bridged read now records a usage event through the shared pipeline
   (model, provider, status, duration — no token counts, because the request
   path receives the transcript rather than the envelope) and logs one
   never-quieted line, so the operator can tell a vision call happened and
   against what. What is still missing is the other half of what "Ship a new
   provider to every installer" requires of everyone else: the ChatGPT plan's
   remaining quota does not move in the tray when a screenshot is transcribed,
   and no surface renders routed usage events at all. It is being closed
   separately. Do not read it as settled, do not weaken this section to
   accommodate it, and do not extend the exception to another engine while it is
   still open.
6. Substituted transcripts are untrusted user data. Keep them fenced and
   labelled as quoted image content, never log a transcript or a gateway error
   body, and keep the per-image failure path degrading to a stated failure
   rather than a failed turn. A stream that fails partway through is a failure,
   not a short transcript: deltas already in hand are discarded rather than
   returned, because a plausible truncated transcript is quoted downstream as
   though it were the whole image.
7. Evidence, not impressions. The instruction set asks for a transcript, a
   layout list, readable data values, and an explicit uncertainty list, so the
   downstream model quotes rather than guesses. Preserve the uncertainty
   section in any rewrite.
   - `## Identification` is the **one** section where inference is allowed, and
     it exists because a pure transcription contract cannot answer "what is
     this?" — which is the most common thing anyone asks about a pasted image.
     Without it the reader described a photo it plainly recognized, and the
     routed model went looking on the internet, uploading the operator's
     screenshot to a public host on the way. Keep it separate from `## Text`,
     keep it required, and keep `(unrecognized)` as the answer when nothing is
     recognizable. Inference belongs in one labelled place, never spread
     through the sections that claim to be a reading.
8. The reader is asked what the operator wants to know, and asked **again when
   that changes**. Pinning the question to the image's own message kept the
   cache still and made an image's reading a snapshot of the first thing ever
   asked about it. The newest image follows the newest question instead. Three
   properties keep that affordable, and all three are load-bearing:
   - Bought once per *question*, never per turn: a question already asked is
     served from the record, so Codex resending the conversation is free.
   - Only the **newest** image follows the conversation. Older images keep the
     question they were read for, so a chat holding ten screenshots cannot turn
     one new question into ten new reads.
   - The record accumulates, so an earlier answer survives a later question.
   The question itself is the operator's words only: Codex's `<image …>` wrapper,
   its `# Files mentioned by the user:` preamble, and its context blocks
   (`<environment_context>`, `<recommended_plugins>`) are bookkeeping, and
   sending them produced transcripts written about a filename.
9. Resolving an engine and **reaching** it are different questions. The reader
   is a short list — the operator's choice first, then the other credentialed,
   non-loopback vision models — and an image is offered to the next one when the
   first cannot be reached. A 401 from a lapsed session and a 503 from a
   provider outage both turned every paste into "could not be read" while the
   engine still resolved perfectly. What the fallback must not become:
   - **Silent.** The evidence header names the engine that actually read the
     image, and the per-turn log line records `fellBack`.
   - **A way around a pin.** A pin that does not *resolve* is still an
     operator-visible problem, never a quiet switch to another model, and a
     pinned **local** engine never falls back onto a provider's quota nobody
     chose to spend.
   - **Expensive.** The list is capped, the candidate set is still built at most
     once per turn, and a second engine is only ever called after the first has
     failed — so a working engine costs exactly what it did before. Another
     provider is tried before another *attempt* at a broken one: retries are
     spent only on the last engine in the list, because waiting out a retry
     ladder against a dead endpoint while a working engine sits behind it is
     how a fallback that works becomes a paste that takes half a minute.
10. A read that fails **transiently** is asked again — twice, at 250ms and 1s.
   The engine is a rate-limited account across a network, and losing an image
   for the whole turn to a 429 that would have cleared in a second is the
   opposite of what the bridge is for. What is not retried is equally
   deliberate: 4xx refusals buy the identical refusal, and a timeout is reported
   rather than retried because the per-attempt budget is already two minutes. A
   transport failure keeps the transport's own wording ("fetch failed"), which
   is how an operator learns their own loopback engine is down.
   - A reading that came back **incomplete** says so in its own header. The
     downstream model cannot otherwise tell "the image does not show that" from
     "the transcript does not mention it", and it answers the first with
     confidence either way. `## Data` is optional by contract and its absence is
     not a bad read. The two causes are reported differently on purpose: a read
     cut off at the size cap left a large image genuinely unread, so it is the
     one case that invites a second look; missing sections mean the engine does
     not follow the format at all -- a small local model answering in prose --
     and reading again returns the same shape, so an invitation there buys a
     loop rather than an answer. Never advertise a second look on every image.
11. Every image the router carries is read, in **both** places Codex puts one:
   parts of a user message, and the `output` of a `function_call_output`. A
   text-only model that has just been handed a transcript still sees the file's
   path in the turn and calls `view_image` on it, and that tool result holds the
   same bytes again. Missing it hands a raw data URL to a provider that rejects
   the whole conversation with an error naming no image
   (`unknown variant image_url, expected text`). Two consequences are load-bearing
   and must survive any rewrite:
   - **Say which file the transcript is of.** A pasted image takes the path from
     Codex's own `<image … path="…">` wrapper, a tool result from the
     `view_image` call that asked for it. Without that link the model pays a tool
     turn plus a full resend of the conversation to open a file it has already
     been given — far more than the read cost. That wrapper is markup, not the
     operator's words, so it is stripped from the question sent to the engine.
   - **A tool result inherits the question that led to it**, so a `view_image`
     round trip lands on the transcript the paste already bought instead of
     buying a second one. It is also the only way a *later* question gets a
     freshly focused read, since the question pinned to an image is the one in
     its own message.
12. An image's evidence is **one record per image, not one transcript per
   question**. The question still decides whether a read has to be bought;
   what gets injected is every reading the router holds for that image. Filing
   one transcript per (image, question) and injecting only the matching one made
   the evidence a snapshot of the first question ever asked, which a later
   question could not add to. Keep the record append-only, keep the first
   (general) reading undroppable when the cap bites, and keep the whole record
   inside the budget a single transcript used to have. When one turn carries the
   same image twice — the paste and the `view_image` result — only the first
   slot prints the record; the rest point at it. That pointer is keyed on the
   image, never on matching transcript text: two different screenshots can read
   identically, and "the same image" has to be a fact about the bytes.
13. One image, one purchase. The transcript cache only knows about reads that
   have **finished**, so concurrent requests — Codex sends them, and a subagent
   runs beside its parent — all missed and all bought the same transcript. Reads
   in flight are shared by image, effort, account, and question; waiters take the
   first read's outcome including its failure, and the shared read is never tied
   to one caller's `AbortSignal`, or one client's cancellation would cost a live
   request an image. Reads within a turn run concurrently under a fixed cap: the
   operator waits for all of them before the routed turn starts, but the engine
   is somebody's rate-limited account and must not receive an album as a burst.
14. Never add a local model to `LOCAL_VISION_CATALOG` with an `accuracy` claim
   that was not measured. Run `node src/vision-benchmark.mjs`, which scores a
   model against a checked-in image with known contents, and record the result
   in `measured`; anything unmeasured stays `untested`. This is not bureaucracy:
   `llava` scores 0% and `moondream` 0% on text while sounding entirely
   plausible, so a reputation-based label would route users straight to a model
   that fabricates invoice numbers. The picker sorts on this field, so an
   unearned "accurate" puts a confident-wrong reader at the top of the list.
15. Which native models may read an image is one rule in one place
   (`src/vision-engines.mjs`), not a criterion each surface re-derives. The
   catalog build, the tray, and the request path each asked it separately once,
   and the three answers disagreed — the request path applied no auth gate at
   all. The rule is shared; only the evidence for the gate differs, because just
   one caller can afford to ask Codex directly (`codexAuthStatus()` spawns a
   process) and only the request path holds the caller's live session. Every
   call site names its evidence explicitly, and the coverage below fails when
   one of them stops.
16. The bridge lives on the **routed request path only**. `src/api-forwarder.mjs`
    sits downstream of the gateway — every routed model's `api_base` points at
    it — so Codex's traffic arrives already bridged and an image reaching that
    hop came from a client talking to the gateway directly. It replaces those
    parts with the same stated failure rather than reading them: an engine call
    from there would re-enter the gateway that is holding the request open. The
    substituted part must use the protocol's own text type (`input_text` for
    Responses, `text` for chat completions and Anthropic messages), or an image
    the provider rejects is merely traded for a text part it rejects.
17. Regression coverage lives in `test/vision-bridge.test.mjs`,
    `test/vision-bridge-state.test.mjs`, the bridged-catalog case in
    `test/catalog.test.mjs`, the whole-path measurements in
    `test/vision-bridge-e2e.test.mjs`, and the router cases in
    `test/routing.test.mjs`. A change to engine ranking, caching, substitution,
    the native gate, or the advertisement rule needs a test there. The two
    properties worth stating as tests rather than prose: nothing image-shaped
    may survive into a forwarded body, and one image asked one question may be
    bought only once however many requests are in flight.

## Anonymous remote providers

`authMode: "anonymous"` is not the same as `keyless`. A keyless provider is
loopback-only and serves from this machine; an anonymous provider sends the
operator's prompt to a fixed remote endpoint under a provider-controlled free
model policy. It must never declare a credential, keyless mode, or a base-URL
override, and the registry loader keeps its endpoint allowlisted.

Anonymous providers are **configured but never defaulted**: the credential
resolver may report them as ready, and an explicit `--providers` choice may
route a free model, but `defaultProviderIds()`, the no-argument setup path,
`--providers configured`, and `ensure-configured` must not add them when the
operator did not ask. Never check in a paid model ID or silently turn on an
anonymous endpoint during installation.

Which free IDs a reseller gateway serves is decided by `anonymousModelAllowed`
in `src/model-registry.mjs`, never by the registry fragment alone, and the
`ANONYMOUS_ENDPOINTS` table beside it is the reason a fragment edit cannot
point a credential-free provider at a model somebody would be billed for.
`opencode-free` and `kilo-free` each expose a large free subset picked out by a
naming rule that changes without notice, so neither ships that subset: discovery
filters the provider's live `/models` response and the user curates locally.

withdrew `ox-alpha-free` and now publishes `glm-5.3-flash` on Chat Completions.
The checked-in route is `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`; the old public slug
`opencode-go/ox-alpha` is a static migration alias so existing picker state and
callers move to the live route instead of reaching a withdrawn upstream ID. The
older curation slug `opencode-go/ox-alpha-free` is an alias to the same target.
OpenCode Go publishes a 1,000,000-token context and 131,072-token output limit
for the named route. Store the provider limit rather than the base model's
1,048,576 architectural maximum. The ordinary 0.85 compaction ratio is not
safe for this route in Codex: large live multimodal histories repeatedly
returned empty completions before that point. Compact conservatively at 400,000
while retaining the provider's advertised context as catalog metadata. This
does not bypass provider moderation; a rejected remote compaction remains a
provider limitation, not a router or stream crash.

No checked-in route preserves the preview under the Ox Alpha name. OpenCode
Free, OpenRouter, and Nous Research withdrew their preview ids. Direct
exact-route probes then rejected `stealth/ox-alpha` on Command Code as
`model_unavailable` on basic, streaming, forced-tool, stateless tool-result,
and compact requests. The available Venice account returned its HTTP 402
billing gate on all five surfaces before `stealth-ox-alpha` could be
wire-certified. Exact probes disable cooldown, response-verdict, and compaction
failover, so neither result can be a healthy alternate answering in disguise.
The repository therefore ships neither preset.

Command Code and Venice discovery still preserve the provider catalog for
explicit operator curation. That is not compatibility certification: a local
entry can fail when the catalog is stale or the account cannot reach inference.
In particular, Venice curation retains the provider-advertised effort metadata;
the repository does not replace it with a cross-provider inference for a route
it could not execute.

The named GLM-5.3-Flash routes on OpenCode Go, OpenRouter, Z.ai API, and Z.ai
Coding did pass direct basic, streaming, forced-tool, stateless tool-result,
and compact probes. Their recorded effort ladder is `low`/`high`/`max`, and it is the
**model's** ladder rather than a generic reseller default. The model always
thinks, and its upstream refuses an off-ladder rung by name:

```
HTTP 400 — [1210] This model always engages in thinking and cannot be
disabled; please use low, high, or max
```

The ladder also collides with the effort clamp in `src/catalog.mjs`. Codex
gained the `max` variant in 0.143.0, so on anything older the catalog rewrites
this model's default down to `xhigh` — a rung every route refuses. The
legacy-named `ox-alpha` request profile in `src/api-forwarder.mjs` closes that
loop for the OpenCode Go and OpenRouter named routes: it clamps whatever Codex
sent onto the rungs the registry entry declares, so `xhigh` and `ultra` land on
`max`, while `medium` and `minimal` land on `low`. An absent effort stays absent
so the upstream default applies, and undocumented `thinking` is stripped. Z.ai
Coding uses its own `glm-thinking` profile. These named routes advertise a
1,000,000-token window, compact at the directly proved conservative 400,000
threshold, and preserve forced `tool_choice: "required"`.

`ollama-cloud/glm-5.3-flash` is checked in as candidate registry metadata with a
model-scoped request profile that clamps both flat and nested reasoning effort
onto the same `low`/`high`/`max` ladder. It must not be called certified until
the public slug passes the router-level exact-route suite for basic, streaming,
forced-tool, stateless tool-result, and compact requests with failover disabled.

`ollama-cloud/glm-5.3` is also checked in as candidate registry metadata on the
same low/high/max ladder and the sibling `ollama-cloud-glm-5-3` clamp profile,
advertising 1,000,000 context and an 880,000 conservative compact threshold
matching the existing Ollama Cloud GLM-5.2 policy. It requires its own run of
the router-level exact-route suite before it is called certified. That
threshold is not a provider-measured boundary. It is text-only: GLM-5.3's
multimodal variant is GLM-5.3-Flash, so the full-size route declares `text`
modality instead of inheriting Flash's image path.

## A provider whose models each name their own endpoint

`custom` is a **container, not a destination**. It declares no `baseUrl`, no
`credential`, and no `protocol`; each of its models carries all three in an
`endpoint` block, and `endpointForModel()` is what every consumer asks instead
of reading `provider.baseUrl`. The loader refuses a container that declares any
of them, because two answers to "where does this go" have a silent winner.

1. **The endpoint descriptor is provider-shaped on purpose.** `baseUrl`,
   `authMode`, `keyless`, and `credential` mean exactly what they mean on a
   provider, so `resolveProviderBaseUrl` and the whole credential chain accept
   one unchanged. Do not grow a parallel resolver: the moment the two
   implementations differ, one of them is the one nobody audited.
2. **Identity is derived, never declared.** `id` is the model slug and `kind`
   is fixed, both injected at load; a fragment that set either could point one
   model's credential file and Keychain entry at another model's secret. The
   loader refuses a fragment that spells them.
3. **Exactly one auth story per endpoint** — anonymous, keyless, or a
   credential. Two would leave a silent winner; none would send an
   unauthenticated request to an address nobody vetted.
4. **The allowlist follows the address down.** An `authMode: "anonymous"`
   endpoint reaches a third party with no credential, so its address must
   appear in `ANONYMOUS_MODEL_ENDPOINTS`, keyed by slug. Without that, adding a
   JSON file under `config/custom/` would be enough to send an operator's
   prompts to any HTTPS host on earth with nothing to authenticate them — which
   is the exact hazard the provider-level allowlist exists to prevent, one level
   down. A `keyless` endpoint stays loopback-only for the same reason, and
   neither may declare a `baseUrlEnv`, because an environment override walks
   around whichever of the two rules applied. An endpoint that carries a
   credential needs no allowlist entry: the key is already the boundary.
5. **Never defaulted.** `defaultProviderIds()` excludes `per-model` alongside
   `anonymous`. What the container holds is whatever somebody put in it, and at
   least one of those addresses is reached with no credential, so "enabling this
   sends prompts off-box" stays a choice a person made.
6. **Nothing offers a key at the container level.** `apiProvider()` refuses it,
   the onboarding card is informational, and `resolveProviderCredential()`
   returns a persistent marker so selection, health, and the catalog still work.
   A key stored against `custom` would be read by nothing.
7. **Discovery refuses it.** Discovery asks one endpoint what it serves, and a
   container is not an endpoint. Picking one of its models' addresses and
   reporting that as the provider's catalog would be worse than the refusal.
8. **Check in metadata you measured.** A `custom` model ships with a verified
   context window, modality set, and effort ladder rather than the conservative
   defaults `curate-models` would guess. An anonymous endpoint answers without a
   credential, so there is no excuse for inferring any of it.

## Cursor target

Cursor is a client target, not a provider. The implementation was measured
against Cursor Agent `2026.08.25-3e8eec8` and Cursor App `3.16.17`.

1. **Cursor Agent speaks Connect/protobuf.** `CURSOR_API_ENDPOINT` points the
   official binary at the router's caller-capability root. The adapter serves
   auth exchange, live routed model catalog/default, `RunSSE`, and
   `BidiAppend`, then re-enters `/v1/responses`. `cursor-router-agent` is the
   installed launcher and keeps the capability out of command arguments.
2. **CLI tool execution stays in Cursor.** The adapter maps read, bash, edit,
   and write calls onto Cursor's typed controlled-exec protocol, waits for the
   client's result, and resumes the model with that result. Cursor therefore
   remains the process that applies its permission mode and touches the local
   workspace; the router never executes a model-requested command or file
   mutation itself. The protocol is covered by wire-level tests and a live
   official-CLI proof. MCP declarations are not advertised because their
   separate exec shape has not received the same proof.
3. **Retail Cursor App is server-mediated.** A loopback base URL is refused as
   private-network access. `--target cursor` therefore requires a stable public
   HTTPS origin whose tunnel forwards only to `127.0.0.1:4214`. The separate
   edge accepts only secret-bearing `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions`,
   translates both Chat Completions and Responses-shaped bodies, and re-enters
   the canonical router path. The main router port stays loopback-only.
4. **Cursor's override is global.** Enabling it can also send Cursor-managed
   model slugs to the custom edge. Routed models use collision-safe
   `codex_router/readable_name__digest/effort` aliases because Cursor rejects a
   custom BYOK id containing a built-in model id before it reaches the edge.
   Cursor gives user-added models no stable native parameter metadata, so each
   supported reasoning effort is a separate picker row and the edge restores
   it as `reasoning.effort`. Turn the override off when returning to
   Cursor-managed models.
5. **Cursor must be stopped for settings writes.** The manager transactionally
   updates the application-user JSON in `state.vscdb`, preserves unrelated
   state, records its owned aliases, and reverses only its own changes. A live
   Cursor process may overwrite an external transaction on exit, so publish,
   republish, repair, and uninstall refuse while it is running.

Three findings from that work generalize to any CLI-backed provider, and cost
real debugging to obtain:

- A CLI's `--stream-partial-output` may not *replace* its message-level
  emitter. cursor-agent runs both, so a turn answering "391" emits two
  `assistant` events each reading "391"; concatenating every one of them
  streams "391391". Reconcile deltas against an accumulator rather than
  trusting that one emitter excludes the other.
- Token usage came back camelCase (`inputTokens`) from the live result while
  the shipped bundle's source spells it snake_case. Reading only the spelling
  the source suggests reported every real turn as zero usage, which the router
  records as a genuinely free turn.
- Reading a vendor's bundled source narrows the guesswork but does not replace
  one real request. Every one of these survived a full green suite built on
  fixtures derived from that source.

## Local models as a provider

`local` is a keyless provider: it serves from this machine, so there is no
credential to store, prompt for, or redact.

Local models are published as **experimental**, and the two roles are not
equally proven. Reading images is dependable: a local vision model transcribes
codes, numbers, and dates exactly, every run. Driving a Codex turn is not: the
same model has passed `local-models agent-check` and failed the identical check
minutes later. Do not quietly drop the label because a check happened to pass.

1. `keyless: true` is only valid with a loopback `baseUrl` and no `credential`
   block; the loader rejects both violations. An unauthenticated provider
   pointed at the internet would send traffic off-box with no key.
2. Checked local models are published into the user-model overlay, the same
   mechanism curated cloud models use. Do not add a second registry path for
   them, and never write local models into the checked-in `config/` tree --
   they exist only on the machine that installed them.
3. A change to the checked set must rewrite **both** the Codex catalog and the
   gateway route table (`refreshModelSettingsCatalog({ routes: true })`).
   Writing one without the other is the drift doctor's "Catalog matches gateway
   routes" check exists to catch.
4. Checking, installing, and removing are three separate actions. Unchecking
   never deletes a download; removing requires explicit consent and unchecks
   the model so nothing stays selected once it is off disk.
5. A local model advertises image input only when its family can actually read
   images -- the same standard the checked-in registry is held to.
6. Codex drives every turn through tool calls, so a local model is publishable
   only when Ollama reports the `tools` capability. Most vision models do not
   have it. `local-models inspect <tag>` reads the registry's chat template to
   answer that before a download, but a template mentioning `.Tools` is
   necessary and not sufficient -- `qwen2.5-coder:7b` advertises tools and
   still returns them as plain JSON text, which Codex cannot dispatch. Treat
   the flag as a filter and a real request as the proof.
7. New providers only reach a running router after the service restarts, since
   the registry and gateway config load at startup. If the router starts
   answering every request with `local_router_error`, suspect a process still
   holding pre-change state rather than the new code.

## Embeddings are a separate, explicitly gated route

1. **A model grants the capability, never a provider name.** `/v1/embeddings`
   accepts only a registered routed model whose `supportedEndpoints` includes
   `/embeddings`. Discovery metadata is untrusted and cannot add that field.
2. **Endpoint-only models are not chat models.** A model that omits its
   provider's conversational endpoint must be `listed: false`; otherwise the
   registry refuses it before the Codex picker can advertise a broken turn.
3. **No chat adapter and no LiteLLM hop.** The router rewrites the public slug
   to the gateway id and calls the internal API forwarder. The forwarder
   rewrites only that id to the upstream model and preserves the remaining
   embeddings JSON. Do not normalize the body as Chat Completions or Responses.
4. **The caller secret never leaves loopback.** Query parameters on the
   capability URL are dropped, only a bounded request id may cross the internal
   hop, and the API forwarder replaces internal auth with the provider's own
   credential inside its established boundary. Both the router-to-forwarder
   and forwarder-to-provider hops refuse redirects so a 307/308 cannot replay
   the POST body onto another destination.
5. **Bound and cancel both directions; never retry.** The public request and
   provider response default to 8 MiB limits, and client cancellation aborts
   both hops. A transport failure may occur after the provider billed the
   input, so automatic replay is not safe without provider-specific evidence.
6. **Every future endpoint is a new protocol review.** This slice does not
   authorize completions, moderation, media, files, or batches. Each needs its
   own capability, wire contract, limits, cancellation, idempotency, and
   retry/stream-commit evidence.

## The Devin CLI provider is unverified, and says so

`devin-cli` reuses the session `devin auth login` writes and spends that
account's ACU credits, the same shape as `kimi-oauth` and `grok-oauth`. What is
not the same is the transport, and that difference governs everything else
about it.

1. **There is no model API.** Cognition documents a *session* API
   (`api.devin.ai`), not a chat API. The models answer only on Cascade —
   `exa.api_server_pb.ApiServerService` over Connect RPC at the
   `api_server_url` the CLI stored. The schemas in `src/devin-proto.mjs` are
   transcribed from the descriptor set embedded in the shipped `devin` binary,
   which is the only published source for them. Treat every field number as
   evidence from one binary version, not as a contract.
2. **Unverified until someone with an account proves it.** No maintainer has
   run a live turn. The registry entry ships no models, the provider is
   catalog-only, and nothing may claim support until `bin/devin-probe --live
   --tools` passes for a real account. Do not set `multiAgentVersion`, do not
   check in model fragments, and do not describe this provider as working in
   README or release notes on the strength of the unit tests alone.
3. **The unit tests prove translation, not the protocol.** `protobuf-wire`,
   `devin-cli-turn`, `devin-cli-status`, and `devin-connect` cover the wire
   codec, the request mapping, the credential reader, and the envelope framing
   against fixtures. They cannot prove Cascade accepts the request. A green
   suite here is necessary and nowhere near sufficient.
4. **The decoder must stay permissive and the credential reader strict.**
   Unknown protobuf fields are skipped, because the upstream adds them without
   notice and a strict decoder would fail whole turns. `credentials.toml` is the
   opposite: it is read through `toml-structure.mjs`, so a duplicate key or a
   value the scanner cannot read plainly is refused rather than guessed at.
5. **The router reads that file and never writes it.** No code path may create,
   move, copy, or delete another tool's credential file, and the token never
   reaches a log, an argument, or an error message. `--no-discovery` must keep
   the file closed entirely.
6. **Entitlement is the account's, not the registry's.** Which models an
   operator may run is decided server-side by `GetCascadeModelConfigs` and team
   settings. Discovery asks; the registry never guesses. A model that appears
   for one account may be absent or refused for another.
7. **Expect drift, and fail loudly when it happens.** An unversioned transport
   can change under a `devin` update. When it does, the symptom is a Connect
   `invalid_argument` on every turn, not a subtle wrong answer — keep it that
   way rather than adding tolerant parsing that would mask a schema change.
   Two rules make "loudly" mean something. First, a Connect error code must
   reach the router as the HTTP status the protocol assigns it: the sixteen-code
   table in `src/connect-stream-audit.mjs` is the single source, imported by the
   client rather than restated, and a code that fell through to 502 would be
   read one layer up as a transient fault in the chain and sent again — which is
   precisely wrong for `unimplemented`, the answer to a service path or method
   name that drifted. Second, the client asks for
   `connect-accept-encoding: identity` and refuses a frame that carries the
   compressed bit anyway (`devin_compressed_frame`). Compressed bytes are not
   protobuf, so decoding them produces an empty turn or an unactionable wire
   error; do not add decompression to this transport on the strength of a
   fixture, because no maintainer can test it against Cascade.
8. **An operator who never curated a Devin model pays nothing for it.** Unlike
   the three forwarders that always run, `src/devin-cli-forwarder.mjs` is
   spawned only when `MODELS` contains a `devin-cli` model, so an unconfigured
   install starts no fourth child, binds no fourth port, and waits on no fourth
   health probe. The gate is deliberately the curated model and not the stored
   credential: a curated model is exactly what makes `writeLiteLlmConfig()`
   emit a `DEVIN_CLI_FORWARD_BASE_URL` route, and both are read from the same
   `MODELS` array on the same boot, so a live gateway route can never point at
   a port nothing bound. Gating on `credentials.toml` instead would trade the
   forwarder's actionable 401 naming `devin auth login` for a bare connection
   error. An unverified provider must stay free for the people not using it —
   apply the same rule to any future provider that needs its own forwarder.

## Codex safety boundaries

- The config manager owns its marked root `openai_base_url` and
  `model_catalog_json` block plus its marked `model_providers.codex-router`
  table and, when the user has no concurrency preference, its marked
  `[agents].max_concurrent_threads_per_session` default. It may change the root
  `model_provider` only when the user explicitly
  enables the tray's login-free mode. In that mode it may also select an
  enabled external `model`; snapshot both previous values in protected router
  state and restore them exactly when the mode is disabled.
- Preserve reasoning settings, profiles, projects, trust, MCP configuration,
  features, and ChatGPT authentication. Preserve `model` and `model_provider`
  outside the explicitly enabled login-free mode.
- A user-initiated macOS tray login-mode change may gracefully restart only the
  registered Codex desktop app. This does not authorize an installation task to
  quit Codex, and the tray must never force-terminate it.
- Do not kill unknown processes on ports 4200-4203, or on the Grok OAuth
  forwarder port 4208. The previous 4100-4103/4108 defaults remain valid only
  when explicitly supplied through the port environment variables.
- Do not print or read credential-file contents. Status commands report presence
  and source only.
- Treat the generated `/_codex-router/.../v1` config path as sensitive local
  authentication. Never paste the complete managed base URL into chat or a
  public issue; use the redacted status or support-bundle output.
- Do not delete retained keys, logs, backups, snapshots, or old state
  directories.
- Do not restart or quit the Codex App from the installation task.

## Discovery-disabled means no credential reader touches anything

An install made with `--no-provider --no-discovery` persists a discovery
kill-switch (`discovery-mode.json`, read through
`src/discovery-mode.mjs` `discoveryDisabled()`, overridable with
`CODEX_ROUTER_NO_DISCOVERY=1|0`). While it is set, the promise is absolute:
no provider credential file, macOS Keychain item, other CLI's OAuth or
session file, or Codex `auth.json` is read, no `codex login status` probe
runs against the real `CODEX_HOME`, and traffic gets a local
`503 router_idle_no_provider` instead of provider or native forwarding.

1. Every new credential reader, sign-in probe, or session consumer must
   consult `discoveryDisabled()` before its first read or spawn and report
   "nothing found" rather than throwing. The guard belongs at the reader, not
   only at its current callers — call graphs move.
2. An explicitly written empty provider selection is a deliberate state, not
   an error: `ensure-configured` reports it as idle, the doctor warns instead
   of failing, and installing or updating on top of it must keep working.
3. Never select a provider, re-enable discovery, or clear the marker on the
   user's behalf. Re-running setup without the flags is the only exit path,
   and it is the operator's to take.
4. The account-aware `codex debug models` (and `models_cache.json`, which is
   that same catalog written to disk) counts as an account read: the catalog
   capture and the doctor's staleness probe use only `debug models --bundled`
   while the switch is set. `test/doctor-idle.test.mjs` proves the bare form
   never spawns.
5. A corrupt `discovery-mode.json` deliberately reads as discovery **on** —
   the opposite direction of the vision-bridge precedent, which fails toward
   off. There the risk is spending quota nobody approved; here the marker
   only ever exists on a machine that installed with `--no-provider`, where
   resuming reads finds no credentials to spend, while failing toward "off"
   on a credentialed install would silently blind every provider over one
   damaged file. `test/discovery-mode.test.mjs` pins the choice.

## The `codex` shim is opt-in and must never break `codex`

`src/codex-shim.mjs` can put a wrapper named `codex` on the user's PATH so the
router is verified up before Codex starts. Installing a file that shadows a
command the user already has is a change only they may authorize.

1. Never install it from `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `doctor --fix`, or any
   automatic repair. It ships behind `model-router codex shim install` only.
2. Never write into a PATH directory outside the user's home directory. A shim
   in `/usr/local/bin` changes `codex` for every account on the machine.
3. Never overwrite or delete a `codex` that does not carry `SHIM_MARKER`.
   Another wrapper there is somebody's deliberate setup, not debris.
4. Never edit shell startup files to put the shim on PATH. When no directory
   ahead of Codex is writable, print the `export PATH=...` line and stop.
5. Every failure path in the generated shim must still `exec` the real Codex.
   A stopped router, a deleted checkout, and a gateway that never becomes
   healthy are all recoverable; a `codex` that refuses to start is not. The
   wait is bounded by `MODEL_ROUTER_SHIM_WAIT`, and `MODEL_ROUTER_SHIM=0`
   bypasses the check.

`test/codex-shim.test.mjs` covers each of these. Do not weaken those tests to
land a change.

## Detecting whether Codex is open

Follow mode ("Show tray: With Codex") decides when the tray is visible and, in
that mode, when the router runs at all. Codex ships both as a desktop app and as
an npm CLI, and only the app has a bundle identifier, so
`NSRunningApplication` alone is not an answer: a bundle-only check reported
"Codex is not running" for every terminal session, hid the menu bar item, and
stopped the router 30 seconds into the user's work.

Detection must cover both — bundle identifiers for the apps, and a process-table
scan for the CLI. Keep the scan in `sysctl`; it runs every five seconds for the
life of the session, and spawning `pgrep` on that cadence is a cost the check
does not justify. `apps/macos/ModelRouterTray/Tests/HostProcessDetectionTests.swift`
guards it.

## The macOS app icon is committed, not built during a tray build

`apps/macos/ModelRouterTray/Resources/AppIcon.svg` is the source and
`AppIcon.icns` beside it is the committed output of `scripts/build-app-icon.sh`.
Regenerate and commit both together after editing the SVG. Do not make
`scripts/build-macos-tray-app.sh` rasterize the icon: it would put `sips` and
`iconutil` on the critical path of every tray build for one asset that changes
almost never. Keep the SVG free of `--` inside comments and of SVG filter
primitives — CoreSVG, which is what `sips` uses, rejects the first and silently
drops the second.

## Upstream retries are legal only before the first relayed byte

`src/upstream-retry.mjs` retries a native upstream request a bounded number of
times. One rule governs it, and breaking it corrupts responses rather than
merely failing them.

1. A retry is legal only while **nothing has been relayed**. The loop lives
   entirely before its callers touch their `ServerResponse`, and the `canRetry`
   predicate (`response.headersSent`, checked again before every retry) is the
   backstop. `copyResponseHeaders` only stages values with `setHeader`, so
   `headersSent` flips when Node flushes the head — on the first body write, or
   on `end()` for a bodyless upstream. Never move a retry around
   `pipeResponse`: an upstream that dies mid-stream has already delivered
   bytes, and replaying it appends a second response to a stream the client is
   reading. `test/native-retry.test.mjs` asserts the caller received the partial
   stream exactly once.
2. Only failures where an intermediary never obtained a response qualify: 502,
   503, 504, Cloudflare's 520-524, and connect-level socket errors. Do not add
   429 — it is rate limiting, its `Retry-After` is relayed, and sleeping for the
   upstream's suggested delay is the hang the bound exists to prevent. Do not
   add 4xx, and do not add 500, where the origin ran and a repeat risks a second
   execution.
3. Keep the bound small. Codex retries roughly five times on its own and the
   two loops multiply, so the router's share (2 retries, 250ms then 750ms) has
   to keep the product a fast failure. A retry is also only *started* while the
   request has been cheap so far — a five-second budget, because a 504 the edge
   spent half a minute producing, or a connect timeout, must not be tripled.
   `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_RETRIES`, `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`, and
   `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_RETRY_BUDGET_MS` tune it; `0` disables it.
4. The request body must stay replayable: encode it into a Buffer once, above
   the retry, so every attempt sends identical bytes under the identical
   `Content-Encoding`. Never hand the loop a stream, and never re-run
   `compressedNativeBody` per attempt — headers and body would be free to
   disagree.
5. An abort stops everything at once, backoff included. Pass the caller's signal
   through to both the fetch and the wait.
6. A silent retry is worse than no retry: it makes a flaky upstream look
   healthy. The retry log line is never gated on `CODEX_ROUTER_QUIET`, which a
   production LaunchAgent hard-sets, and the usage event carries `retries` so a
   turn the router rescued is distinguishable from one that never failed. Log
   the status or the transport error's own name and code — never a response
   body, and never the caller capability path.

## Moving a turn to another model is legal only before the first relayed byte

`src/model-failover.mjs` decides when a turn whose provider reported it has no
usage left is rebuilt for a different model, and `buildRoutedRequest` in
`src/router.mjs` is what makes rebuilding it possible. The rules are narrow on
purpose; several of them exist because the obvious wider version is wrong.

1. The **same relayed-byte rule as upstream retries**, for the same reason. The
   failover branch lives before `pipeResponse`, and `nothingRelayed(response)`
   is re-checked before every hop. Never move it around `pipeResponse`: a
   mid-stream swap grafts a second response onto a stream the client is reading,
   and duplicates any tool call the client has already executed. That second
   hazard is worse than the duplicated stream and has no equivalent in the retry
   path.
2. Only **"your usage is gone"** qualifies: `upstreamFailureKind` returning
   `out_of_usage`, a 402, or a 429 whose `Retry-After` exceeds sixty seconds. Do
   not add 401 or 403 — a swap would hide the rejected credential that is the
   only thing worth telling the operator. Do not add 404 or 400, which are
   deterministic. Do not add 5xx: `upstream-retry.mjs` already absorbs the
   transient shapes, and masking a provider outage costs an incident somebody
   would want to see. Do not lower the 429 threshold; trading a twenty-second
   wait for a cold prompt cache is a bad deal for the rest of the session.
   Entitlement failures are classified **before** quota ones and never swap,
   because "upgrade your plan" appears in both vocabularies and no other
   provider's quota makes a missing entitlement true.
   Claude Code excludes billing errors from its own fallback on the reasoning
   that they usually mean misconfiguration. That reasoning does not hold here:
   with thirty providers configured, an exhausted plan is a daily event and
   having somewhere else to go is the whole point of the install.
3. **Never trade a quota error for a context error.** A candidate is eligible
   only when its `contextWindow` can hold `estimateInputTokens` of the bytes the
   turn was about to send. That estimate errs high by design, which is the safe
   direction. Falling from a 1M-context model onto a 262K one mid-session is a
   strictly worse turn than the one it replaced.
4. **Never fail over inside the same provider family.** Compare
   `canonicalProviderId`: protocol variants share one credential and therefore
   one quota, so a sibling is guaranteed to fail the same way.
5. **A cooldown is only ever a window the provider itself named.** Derived from
   `Retry-After`, `cooldownUntil`, or a wall-clock reset the provider stated in
   its own refusal body — Z.ai's Coding Plan sends "Your limit will reset at
   2026-09-01 21:32:15" and no header, and without reading it an exhausted plan
   is re-attempted once per turn for the whole window. A bare stamp carries no
   zone, so it is resolved to the **earliest** instant any real UTC offset
   allows that has not already passed, and ignored outright when no offset can
   place it ahead. Waking early costs one refusal; waking late withholds a model
   the operator is paying for, and reading a zoneless stamp as local time does
   exactly that for anyone whose clock does not match the plan's. Never
   invented, capped at six hours, and
   cleared on that provider's next successful answer. A provider under cooldown
   is skipped before dispatch, which is the entire saving — so a cooldown that
   is wrong strands the operator's chosen model, and that is why nothing may
   record one from a guess. `control failover reset` and the doctor's report
   exist so a wrong one is visible and removable.
6. **Bounded**: at most two hops, a thirty-second budget for the whole sequence,
   abort-aware, stop on the first success. When nothing is eligible, return the
   failure the operator's own model gave — it is the one they can act on.
7. **Never silent, and never in the transcript.** The log line is not gated on
   `CODEX_ROUTER_QUIET`, which a production LaunchAgent hard-sets. Both attempts
   are metered and the serving row carries `failoverFrom`. Do not "helpfully"
   inject a notice into the stream: Codex replays assistant output as input, so
   a router-authored sentence comes back next turn as something the model
   believes it said.
8. **The rebuild must start from the pristine payload.** `buildRoutedRequest`
   writes to neither `payload` nor the aged input, and this is load-bearing in
   two places. `flattenNamespaceTools` only recognizes `type: "namespace"`
   items, so a second pass over already-flattened tools returns an *empty*
   namespace map — plausible tools with no way to map the model's calls back.
   And `carryReasoningThroughInput` replaces reasoning items in place, so a
   responses-native second pass would find them already gone. The input array is
   copied before it is rewritten — and copied **only when it is an array**,
   because `input` is equally legal as a bare string and spreading one produces
   an array of single characters, which reaches the provider and still reads as
   a 200. `test/router-timing-log.test.mjs` caught exactly that.
9. `selectedConfiguredListedModels()` is **not** cheap: it probes every
   provider's credential synchronously and spawns `/usr/bin/security` per
   keychain service on macOS. Call it only once a failure or a cooldown is
   already known, never on the happy path.
10. Coverage lives in `test/model-failover.test.mjs` (classifier, ranking,
    cooldown store) and `test/model-failover-router.test.mjs` (end to end,
    including that the failed attempt's bytes never reach the client). A change
    to the trigger set, the ranking, or the cooldown rules needs a test there.

**Not implemented: the native ChatGPT tier.** Falling back to the signed-in
ChatGPT plan is deliberately absent. It is not a body swap but the other branch
entirely, and it crosses the routed/native boundary this file governs
elsewhere — `encrypted_content` rewriting, the compatibility relay, the
collaboration envelope. Those rules require live marker-return probes through
every installed routed agent before a change ships, so the tier cannot be added
from the test suite alone. Add it with those proofs or not at all.

## Command Code is reached by two routes, and the plan picks which

Command Code sells one catalog behind two surfaces, and the documented one is
an entitlement rather than a credential. `POST /provider/v1/chat/completions`
and `/provider/v1/messages` are the published Provider API; an account below
the Provider plan signs in, mints a real key, runs the official CLI all day,
and is still answered
`403 {"error":{"code":"upgrade_required","message":"Your Go plan doesn't
include API access…"}}`. `POST /alpha/generate` is the route the `command-code`
CLI itself uses for every turn it takes, and it is not plan-gated. Serving the
cheap plans means speaking that route.

1. **The fallback is a route change, never a provider split.** `commandcode`
   and `commandcode-messages` stay one family with one credential and one
   catalog, exactly as the provider checklist requires. What changes is where
   the turn is sent, which is why this lives in `src/api-forwarder.mjs` beside
   the Copilot replay rather than in a forwarder of its own.
2. **Only the entitlement refusal may move a turn.** `isUpgradeRequired()` in
   `src/commandcode-plan.mjs` demands a 403 *and* the `upgrade_required` code
   (or its message). A timeout, a 500, or a rate limit says nothing about the
   plan, and reading one as a refusal would quietly move a paying
   Provider-plan account onto its coding-plan credits. Any other 403 is
   relayed with the provider's own message.
3. **It is legal because nothing has been relayed yet.** The refusal arrives
   before the first response byte reaches the caller, which is the same
   boundary the upstream-retry and model-failover rules draw. A fallback after
   a relayed byte would not be legal and is not attempted.
4. **The verdict is remembered per credential, not per process.**
   `commandcode-plan.json` stores a SHA-256 fingerprint of the key — never the
   key — so a new key after an upgrade re-probes, and a six-hour window
   re-checks a plan that changed under the same key. A success is written only
   when that window came due, so a healthy account does not rewrite state once
   per turn.
5. **The envelope is reverse-engineered, so re-derive it rather than guess.**
   Command Code publishes no reference for `/alpha/generate`. The shapes in
   `src/commandcode-generate.mjs` and `src/commandcode-stream.mjs` came from
   the shipped bundle at `$(npm root -g)/command-code/dist/cli.mjs` (v1.14.1)
   and were confirmed against the live gateway. Three traps are load-bearing:
   `config` is schema-strict and every field is required, `memory` is a string
   and not an object, and `params.messages` is the Vercel AI SDK
   `ModelMessage[]` schema — not Anthropic blocks and not OpenAI tool
   messages. The response is newline-delimited JSON despite the
   `text/event-stream` content type, its blocks interleave, and the trailing
   `tool-call` event keys on `toolCallId` where every incremental event keys
   on `id`.
6. **An empty `system` field is not "no system prompt".** It is a cue to
   splice in the Command Code agent's own preamble. Measured against the live
   gateway, the same one-line turn cost 92 prompt tokens with a system prompt
   and 7,637 without, and the model spent them being told it was Command Code
   with Command Code's tools. A turn carrying none gets a neutral one.
7. **Billing differs even though the models do not.** The Provider plan pays
   as it goes; a coding plan spends plan credits against 5-hour and weekly
   window caps and per-model allowances. That is what the `planNote` is for,
   and it is why the note stays on the registry entry now that the plan no
   longer blocks access outright.

## Substituting a prompt-token count a provider reported as zero

Codex decides when to compact from the `input_tokens` each response reports, so
a provider that answers a large prompt with an explicit zero disables
compaction entirely and the session runs until the provider rejects the turn.
The router replaces that number on the way to Codex. The rules are narrow on
purpose.

1. Only an **explicit zero** is replaced, and only on a **routed** response
   whose request the router measured as large. A missing usage block, a missing
   prompt field, and any positive count are all forwarded untouched, so a
   provider that reports correctly never sees this path and the substitution
   stops by itself the moment the upstream recovers. Do not widen the predicate
   into "the number looks wrong".
2. The estimate errs **high**. Compaction sits below the provider's hard limit
   (900,000 of 1,048,576 for the affected models, a 14% margin), so an estimate
   that lands low still lets the turn die, while a high one only compacts
   sooner. Do not "improve" the ratio toward accuracy without re-checking that
   margin, and do not add a tokenizer dependency or download for it.
3. Telemetry keeps what the **provider** said. The usage event records the
   reported counts verbatim and adds `estimatedInputTokens` beside them; the
   log line names the substitution. Never fold the estimate into `inputTokens`
   — a run of estimated turns is the evidence that the provider is still
   broken, and an overwritten field would read as a recovery.
4. The response body is otherwise byte-identical, including bytes that are not
   valid UTF-8: the rewrite path forwards the original buffers and re-encodes
   only the one `data:` line it replaces, preserving framing and terminators.
   Do not reintroduce a decoded-text passthrough, which silently rewrites a
   malformed byte to U+FFFD.
5. If a provider is ever added that reports prompt tokens *excluding* cache
   hits, a fully cached turn could report a truthful zero. Substituting there
   is still right for compaction — cached tokens occupy the context window —
   but say so in that provider's registry work rather than discovering it from
   a surprised user.
6. Regression coverage lives in `test/response-usage.test.mjs` and the
   `prompt-token estimate` cases in `test/routing.test.mjs`. A change to the
   predicate, the ratio, or the telemetry needs a test there.

## Routed subagent regression prevention

- A normal `/responses` smoke test does not cover Codex collaboration. Current
  model-generated subagent tasks and messages can arrive as native
  `encrypted_content`, with visible text ending at `Payload:`. External models
  cannot read that payload directly.
- The compatibility relay must remain signed-in-only and fail closed. Send its
  native request with `stream: true`, accept SSE by body framing as well as
  content type, recognize padded `gAAAA...=` ciphertext, and treat non-Fernet
  `encrypted_content` from an external parent as plaintext.
- The same rule applies in reverse, and it is not conditional on the envelope.
  A routed subagent cannot mint an OpenAI token, so Codex stores its readable
  handoff under `agent_message.content[].encrypted_content` whatever the
  surrounding `Message Type:` rendering looks like. Before forwarding to a
  native Responses endpoint — `/responses` and `/responses/compact` alike —
  rewrite every non-Fernet `encrypted_content` part of an `agent_message` to
  `input_text`; that schema accepts only `input_text`, `input_image`, and
  `encrypted_content`, so `output_text` is not a fallback. Classify on the
  ciphertext format (the `gAAAAA` Fernet prefix over base64url with no
  whitespace), never on whether the plaintext looks readable, and forward a
  value that passes byte-identical. Do not gate this on a router-written
  sentinel: the router never authors these items, and a marker would strand
  the already-broken conversations this recovers.
- Never log relay response bodies, decrypted task text, or exception messages
  that can echo either. Regressions require fragmented/mislabeled SSE tests and
  real marker-return probes through every installed routed agent plus a
  same-thread follow-up.
- A test that isolates the state directory must isolate `CODEX_HOME` with it.
  `MODEL_ROUTER_STATE_DIR` and `CODEX_ROUTER_STATE_DIR` do not redirect
  `CODEX_AGENTS_DIR`, which is `$CODEX_HOME/agents`, and `src/catalog.mjs`
  prunes that directory to the exact registry-v2 routes the state it just read
  leaves enabled and visible.
  Point the state at a scratch directory while inheriting the real home and the
  run deletes the operator's own routed agent definitions — every model
  selected in the real state can disappear from that scratch publication —
  while `multi-agent-settings.json` and `multi-agent-proofs.json` live in the
  scratch state. The operator sees subagents reset after an unrelated command.
  `test/state-owner.test.mjs` pins this: no test file may spawn the catalog
  without setting `CODEX_HOME`.

## Installing the harness is one action, and it is never a side effect

`dsh-config-manager.mjs` publishes routed models into a harness that is already
there. On a machine without one that assumption is a manual `npm install -g` the
user has to find in the docs, so `src/dsh-install.mjs` owns the other half.

- `control harness setup` installs `@deepseek-ai/dsh` globally if `dsh` is
  absent, then publishes. `control harness status` reports without touching
  anything. The tray's Settings row drives the same command.
- Global, not `npx`. The harness's own README documents `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh
  web`, which refetches per run and leaves no `dsh` behind — and an npx process
  is invisible to `presence-state.mjs`, which has to be able to see the client
  to keep the router up for it.
- Never folded into `apply`, `enable`, or a repair path. It installs a
  third-party package over the network; that must be something a user asked for
  in as many words, not a consequence of something else.
- Node is checked before npm is reached. The package declares no `engines`, so a
  stale runtime otherwise fails at first boot with a syntax error from inside
  `node_modules`. Compare major and minor numerically — `22.9` sorts above
  `22.19` as a string.
- Install then publish, with no rollback between them. A publish that fails
  leaves an installed harness, which is where a retry wants to start, and the
  publish is idempotent so the retry is a re-run of the same call.
- `npm-global-install.mjs` holds the npm mechanics for both this and the
  provider CLIs. One copy, because the details that took a debugging session to
  get right — the PATH a spawn inherits, where npm drops binaries per platform,
  which line of npm's output is worth showing — are exactly what drifts.
- Native GPT models are published only while `codex-native-session.mjs` reports
  both explicit shared-plane authorization and a usable session: they need a
  ChatGPT session, and a harness request carries none of its own. One
  `chatgpt-session enable` applies to every local client for this OS user; they
  are withheld again the moment authorization is revoked or the session is
  missing or expired. The count the button reports is the routable set, not the
  picker.

`src/dsh-web.mjs` starts and finds the browser UI, so the tray's button can be
`Open site` once there is a site to open.

- Adopt, never collide. The harness binds a fixed port rather than picking a
  free one, so a second launch exits with `EADDRINUSE` and takes the click with
  it. `startDshWeb` probes first and returns `startedNow: false` when something
  already answers.
- Stop only what this router started, the same rule `ollama-runtime.mjs`
  follows. PID plus process start identity are persisted together and both must
  match, because PIDs are reused; `src/process-identity.mjs` holds that check
  for both callers.
- The probe asks whether the port answers, not what is behind it. A 404 from the
  harness's own router is a running harness, and fingerprinting somebody else's
  HTML to be surer would be worse than the ambiguity.
- The port is a setting (`MODEL_ROUTER_DSH_WEB_PORT`), not a constant. `dsh web
  --port` exists, and a user who moved theirs must not be sent to a dead URL.
- Setup does not start the UI. It already installs a package and writes another
  program's configuration; adding a server launch makes one click three
  consequential things, and the last is the one the user can do themselves a
  moment later. Starting is its own button, so a republish never puts a browser
  window on screen that nobody asked for.
- `control --json` must carry the *web-aware* snapshot. It is what the tray
  polls, and the cheap synchronous variant reports no `web` at all, which reads
  as "stopped" and offers to start a harness that is already serving.
- Stopping and disconnecting are different questions, and the row asks whichever
  one currently costs something. While the harness is resident it holds a Node
  process and its plugin tree in memory -- ~184 MB measured -- so the secondary
  action is **Turn off**, which stops the process and leaves the route
  published. Once nothing is running, the only thing left to undo is the
  integration, so it becomes **Disconnect**. A harness this router did not start
  is never signalled; the row says where it came from instead.
- Turning a client off is not a reason to tear the plane down. `bin/disable`
  removes the service only once `installedTargets()` is empty; disabling the
  harness while Codex is still published used to uninstall the LaunchAgent and
  stop Codex working too. `control harness disconnect` is the tray's path and
  never touches the service at all.
- The default model is the user's. Restore only over a default this router
  wrote — the harness's own Models page writes the same key, and a snapshot
  taken before their choice is not a licence to undo it. With no snapshot but a
  router-owned default, remove the key rather than leave the harness pointed at
  a provider the same uninstall just deleted. All three cases are covered in
  `test/dsh-config-manager.test.mjs`.


## Native GPT for a client with no ChatGPT login of its own

Native traffic is authorized by the caller's session: `nativeHeaders` copies
`authorization` and `chatgpt-account-id` off the incoming request, and Codex
attaches both. A harness turn attaches neither, so native models advertised to
it were models it could never spend.

`src/codex-native-session.mjs` closes that by falling back to the session this
machine is already signed in with, in `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, only after the
user authorizes that use once. `native-session-consent.json` is an owner-only
marker carrying no credential and belongs to the shared router plane: asking
the same OS user to sign in or authorize once per harness buys nothing.

- **Consent fails closed.** A missing, malformed, or unrecognized marker means
  off. `chatgpt-session enable` refuses until `codex login` has produced a
  usable session, then republishes every installed client; `disable` removes
  the marker and republishes them again without signing Codex out. The
  `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_SESSION_FALLBACK=1` environment override is the explicit
  headless opt-in, while `0` is an emergency off switch. No other value is
  consent.

- **Fallback, never override.** Injection happens only when the request carried
  no *upstream* credential. Codex always carries one, so a Codex turn is
  byte-identical to before — verified by relaying a deliberately invalid token
  and getting that token's own 401 back rather than a success.
- **"No credential" is not "no header".** The harness authenticates to this
  router with the router's own caller key, sent as a bearer token, because a
  provider route has nowhere else to put one. Testing `!headers.authorization`
  therefore never fired for a real harness turn: the caller key went upstream
  and every turn came back "API key is invalid". Compare the presented bearer
  token against `CALLER_KEY` and `INTERNAL_KEY` and treat a match as no upstream
  credential. When there is nothing to substitute, delete the header rather than
  forward it — a router secret must never leave the machine.
- Test the shape the client actually sends. A curl with no `Authorization`
  header at all passes the naive guard and proves nothing.
- **The native endpoint accepts a narrower request than the public Responses
  API.** `store` must be `false`, `stream` must be `true`, and ten parameters a
  generic OpenAI client sends are rejected one at a time as bare 400s:
  `temperature`, `top_p`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `max_tokens`,
  `max_output_tokens`, `metadata`, `seed`, `user`, `truncation`. Codex complies
  already, so the payload is normalized *only* for a caller whose session was
  substituted — a Codex turn is never rewritten. `reasoning`, `tool_choice`,
  `parallel_tool_calls`, and `instructions` are accepted and must survive; the
  strip is a denylist for that reason, not a whitelist. Measure any change to
  that list against the live endpoint rather than guessing.
- **Publishable exactly while spendable.** `dshRoutedModels()` includes native
  models only while `nativeSessionAvailable()` is true, so the harness is never
  offered a model that would 401. `visibility: "hide"` entries stay unpublished:
  they are Codex's own internals, a watermarked build and the auto-review model.
- **The credential never leaves the process.** It is not logged, not returned by
  a status call, and not put in an error message. `nativeSessionStatus()` reports
  presence, usability, and age — `test/codex-native-session.test.mjs` asserts the
  serialized status contains neither the token nor the account id.
- **It widens the caller key.** With sharing authorized, anything holding that
  local key spends the ChatGPT subscription and not only the API-key providers.
  That is a deliberate, user-made tradeoff recorded once for the shared plane;
  `chatgpt-session disable` revokes it everywhere and the clients silently drop
  back to routed models only.
- **The access token lives about ten days, and Codex renews it only when Codex
  is used.** A harness-only stretch longer than that would otherwise leave the
  router sending a dead token. `nativeSessionHeaders()` reads the `exp` claim
  and declines two minutes early, so an expired session withholds the headers
  and `dshRoutedModels()` stops publishing native models — the picker loses the
  eight rather than serving certain 401s.
- **Codex refreshes its own credential; this router never does.** Reproducing
  that OAuth exchange would mean guessing an unpublished client identity and, if
  refresh tokens rotate, either rewriting Codex's own file or invalidating the
  login this router was asked not to disturb. `refreshViaCodex()` runs
  `codex login status` instead — best effort, single-flight, at most once every
  five minutes — and lets Codex decide. If nothing renews, the session simply
  reads as expired.
- `doctor` reports it as its own line, because "open Codex once" is the fix and
  nothing else would say so.

## A client the tray cannot watch keeps the router on

The tray's presence setting can tie the router to the Codex and ChatGPT desktop
apps, stopping it 30 seconds after both close. That is only safe for a client
the tray can actually see. `NSRunningApplication` enumerates app bundles, so it
sees the desktop apps and nothing else — a `codex` TUI in a terminal and a `dsh`
harness turn both register nothing at all. Neither can be started on demand
either: a turn that finds 127.0.0.1:4202 closed fails immediately, while the
five-process stack behind that port takes up to 300 seconds to warm, so lazy
start does not exist at request latency. The port has to already be open.

- `effectivePresenceMode()` in `src/presence-state.mjs` is what the tray and
  `doctor` act on. It reports `always` whenever `dsh-models.json` exists or
  `codex` resolves on PATH, whatever the stored mode says. Read it, never
  `readPresenceMode()`, anywhere a service gets stopped.
- Detection errs toward finding a client. A false positive costs a dormant
  toggle; a false negative costs somebody their next request.
- The stored mode is overridden, never rewritten. Removing the harness route or
  the CLI hands the user's own choice back on the next read.
- The router owns the rule and the tray consumes it: `control --json` carries a
  `presence` block, and the tray reads `presence.effectiveMode` rather than
  re-deriving anything from target flags, which is where the two would drift.
  The field is optional in the Swift decoder, so a tray keeps working against a
  router that predates it.
- `test/presence-state.test.mjs` covers both signals, the override, the round
  trip, and the fact that always-on is left alone. A change to the gate needs a
  test there.

## Generated media and scratch output

- Anything a skill, tool, or agent produces that is not source — rendered
  video, images, audio, benchmark dumps, one-off reports — belongs in
  `generated/` at the repository root. That directory is gitignored, so the
  working tree stays clean and nothing large lands in a commit by accident.
- Do not add per-extension ignore rules (`*.mp4`, `*.png`) for this. They also
  hide checked-in assets such as tray icons and documentation screenshots.
- Files that are meant to ship — icons, fixtures, docs assets — go in their
  real home under version control, not in `generated/`.
