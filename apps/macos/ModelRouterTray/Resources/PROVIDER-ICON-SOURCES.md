# Provider icon sources

The tray bundles provider marks discovered through each provider's official
site metadata on 2026-07-22. Monochrome favicon artwork is stored as
white-on-transparent so it remains legible on the Island's black bezel; Kimi's
blue accent and DeepSeek's original blue mark are preserved.

The Z.AI, Qwen, Ollama, Cline, MiniMax, and Meta AI marks were fetched on
2026-08-15. The Venice, Nous Research, and OpenRouter marks were fetched on
2026-08-23 and stored as the same monochrome white-on-transparent adaptation
the other single-color marks use, because all three ship dark artwork that
would be invisible against the Island's black bezel. The opencode-go routes reuse the OpenCode Free mark rather than
shipping a duplicate asset. The NanoGPT mark was fetched on 2026-08-29 and is
bundled losslessly from the official favicon. `custom` deliberately ships no mark at all: it is a
container for whatever endpoints an operator puts in it, and its models come
from different vendors, so any single logo would misattribute the rest.

The marks remain trademarks of their respective owners.
