// Bounded retry for an upstream request that failed before any byte of the
// response reached the caller.
//
// ChatGPT's edge intermittently answers a native turn with
// "upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers", and the router
// relayed that 503 straight through. "Before headers" is the whole point: no
// response bytes ever existed, so the request can be sent again and the caller
// never learns it happened. Codex reacts to the relayed 5xx by spending one of
// its own five reconnects on a failure that one short retry absorbs.
//
// The safety rule this module exists to enforce: a retry is only ever legal
// while nothing has been relayed. That is guaranteed structurally -- the loop
// runs entirely before the caller touches its own `ServerResponse` -- and the
// `canRetry` predicate is the second line of defence, re-checked before every
// single retry. Retrying after partial output would duplicate the stream.

// to stay small enough that the product is still a fast failure.
