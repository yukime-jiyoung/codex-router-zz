// the body instead produces a well-formed, if short, HTTP message.
//
// A gracefully ended SSE stream, though, is indistinguishable from a completed
// one: the turn would simply look short and successful. So on `text/event-stream`
// we first emit a terminal `error` event, matching the event framing the router
// already writes elsewhere and the Responses API's own `error` event. A parser
// that understands it surfaces a real failure; one that does not ignores the
// unknown event and lands on the plain graceful end, which is still strictly
// better than a reset. The frame carries a fixed router-side message and never
// upstream error text, so no response body can leak through it.
//
// The frame is prefixed with a blank line because the stream is being ended at
// the point upstream died, which is very often mid-line: transforms forward
// upstream's chunk boundaries verbatim, and a single `output_text.delta` can
// carry a long span. Writing `event: error` straight onto an unterminated
// `data:` line does not produce an error event at all -- a conforming parser
// reads the field name as more of the previous event's data, so the failure
// signal turns into garbage appended to the last delta, which is exactly the
// silent corruption this function exists to avoid. Leading newlines are inert
// when the stream did end cleanly: a blank line with no buffered fields
// dispatches nothing.
// `message` lets a caller that diagnosed the failure say so; the code stays
// fixed, because a diagnosed cause is more detail about this same failure and
// not a second kind of it. The default wording holds for every caller that
// reaches here with nothing more specific -- a guessed cause is worse than an
