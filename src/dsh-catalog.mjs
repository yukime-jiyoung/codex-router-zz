//
// The harness reads provider routes from `dsh-llm-pi-ai`, which its shipped
// bundle mounts *dormant*: zero routes until an `llm-pi-ai:` settings section
// supplies profiles. So publishing every routed model into the harness is a
// settings write, not a plugin or composition change, and the harness picks it
// up on its next request because `dsh-settings-file` hot-reloads the document.
//
// Routed models are always published. An unregistered slug on the router's
// `/v1/responses` endpoint is treated as native GPT traffic, which needs a
// ChatGPT session the harness does not carry — so a native model is published
// only after this user authorizes the shared router plane and while
// `codex-native-session.mjs` can substitute the session this machine is signed
// in with. It is withheld again the moment either condition stops holding. See
// `dshNativeModels` below.
