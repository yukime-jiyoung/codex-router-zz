// Per-spawn accounting for child turns, and the only signal the router has
// that a child is looping rather than working.
//
// The router sees HTTP turns, not agent lifecycles: a child makes one turn per
// tool-call round trip and the loop stringing them together is Codex's. So
// "the child reached done" is not observable here, and neither is a terminal
// turn in any positive sense -- the turn that ended a spawn is only knowable
// afterwards, by no further turn arriving on that thread. That is exactly why
// no positive terminal-turn detector is needed: a ceiling can only ever be
// crossed by a spawn that is *still producing turns*, which is the same
// statement as "this spawn has not converged". A converged child stops, and a
// spawn that stopped never reaches the ceiling.
//
// What has to be defensible is the ceiling, and the repository already names
// both the pathology and its unit. `context-window-drift.mjs` describes the
// runaway shape verbatim: a task that opens above its own compaction
// threshold, summarizes, "lose[s] the agent's working state, redo[es] the same
// opening work, and compact[s] again without ever finishing. Nothing errors.
// The session simply never ends" -- the same failure the v0.4.0-beta.4
// changelog records for understated windows (#266). The unit in that sentence
// is the model's auto-compact budget, which every listed model already carries
// (`autoCompact`, validated in model-registry.mjs and derived from the
// provider's own declared window at AUTO_COMPACT_RATIO). It is per model, it
// is published by the provider, and nobody here invented it.
//
// The multiple is read off the same sentence. One compaction budget of new
// input is a large but legitimate task -- a child that reads a big file
// reaches it honestly. It is *compacting again* that names the runaway, so the
// ceiling is two budgets of new input with the child still going.
//
// That multiple is also what makes false negative evidence structurally
// impossible rather than merely unlikely. Historical proof records are only
// diagnostic now, but invented failure evidence would still mislead a registry
// review. A spawn that has never been
// compacted cannot have produced more new input than its own largest prompt,
// so the ceiling is taken against whichever is bigger, the model's declared
// budget or the largest prompt this spawn has actually had accepted. An
// uncompacted spawn's total is then exactly half its own ceiling, however long
// its task runs and whatever the catalog declares -- the invariant holds even
// for a model whose `autoCompact` sits far below its window, which the registry
// validator permits (it requires only 1 <= autoCompact <= contextWindow), and
// for the single oversized tool result that can carry one turn past the
// compaction limit in one step. Crossing the ceiling therefore requires the
// child to have filled its context, been summarized, and filled it again
// without stopping. That is not a big task; it is the runaway, stated in the
// only unit the router can see.
//
// One thing this cannot separate, and does not pretend to: Codex reuses a
// child thread for a FOLLOWUP_TASK, so a thread that is delegated to twice is
// one spawn here. That is the conservative reading -- the child's context does
// carry across, so the tokens really are cumulative -- and a child left idle
// between delegations is expired by IDLE_SPAWN_MS below rather than
// accumulating forever.
