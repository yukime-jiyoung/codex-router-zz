// OpenCode's anonymous catalog exposes documented free models on Chat
// Completions and one on Responses. Keep this mapping deliberately separate
// from paid Zen and the Go subscription family: those providers have different
// catalogs and billing semantics.
//
// Zen's live /models response publishes ids, `object`, `created`, and
// `owned_by` -- no context limit and no effort control for any model. Without
// documented metadata every free id falls back to the generic 131,072 window
// and a single `high` effort, which compacts every tool-bearing turn on a
// million-token route (#266) and hides an effort ladder the model really has
// (#352).
//
// Everything below comes from OpenCode's own published model metadata (the
// `opencode` provider in https://models.dev/api.json, whose record points at
// https://opencode.ai/zen/v1 and https://opencode.ai/docs/zen). That dataset
// keys `limit` and `reasoning_options` per *free id*, not per model, and
// demonstrably records a smaller window when the free route is capped below
// the paid one -- `deepseek-v4-flash` publishes 1,000,000 while
// `deepseek-v4-flash-free` publishes 200,000, and `minimax-m3` publishes
// 512,000 against `minimax-m3-free`'s 200,000. So a free id's figure describes
// the free route's own served cap.
//
// A documented window is stored only when curation's 0.85 auto-compact ratio
// still leaves at least the id's published `limit.output` in reserve, so
// compaction fires before a completion can overrun the window the entry just
// declared. Where it does not, the id keeps the conservative default and says
// so in its own description rather than declaring a window a full-length
// answer can walk off the end of. Two live free ids are therefore absent from
// this table entirely, because neither their window nor an effort ladder
// survives that test: `mimo-v2.5-free` (200,000 window, 32,000 output, so
// 0.85 leaves 30,000) and `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` (262,144 window and a
// 262,144 output limit, which no ratio can reserve room for). Both publish an
// empty `reasoning_options`. They keep the stock "conservative default
// metadata" description, which is this repository's existing way of saying
// every value in the entry is a default rather than a documented capability.
//
// Evidence is restated in `descriptions` because that is where this
// repository records metadata that is not a conservative default (see
// config/zai/coding/glm-5.3.json). A future figure in Zen's own /models
// response is still preferred by curate-models, because that one describes the
// served route first-hand.
