// against it. When a provider answered 200 to a prompt larger than the window
// we advertise, the window is not "probably" wrong -- the provider itself
// disproved it, and the only question is by how much.
//
// This matters because the failure is silent and asymmetric. Codex compacts at
// the auto-compact limit derived from that window, so an understated window
// makes a legitimate task open above its own compaction threshold, summarize,
// lose the agent's working state, redo the same opening work, and compact
// again without ever finishing. Nothing errors. The session simply never ends,
// and the model takes the blame. An overstated window fails the honest way
// instead: one upstream rejection that names the real limit.
//
// The evidence is already on disk. This reads it rather than probing, so the
// check costs no quota and no network.

// A provider reporting more input tokens than it could possibly have accepted
// is a metering bug, not a window discovery. Anything beyond this multiple of
// the declared window is treated as unusable rather than believed.

// provider reports zero, and an estimate cannot disprove a provider's own
// limit.
// An empty-completion retry sends the same prompt twice and both attempts are
// billed, so the meter deliberately sums them (mergeTokenUsage) and the turn
// lands as a normal 200 carrying roughly double the prompt it actually sent.
// Believed as capacity that is a ~2x window overstatement invented out of one
// retry -- and the remediation this check prints is "raise the window", so the
// bad sample would talk an operator into doubling a correct number.

// rows keep the selected attempt in `inputTokens` and the aggregate cost in
// `billedInputTokens`; those are valid context measurements. Older rows only
// have the retry marker and remain excluded because their count was summed.
// Bare `retries` is not excluded — a transport retry records only the
