// Startup gates each service on an HTTP health probe. The loop used to treat
// every failed probe the same, and that was the defect: on loopback, a port
// with nothing behind it refuses instantly, so a refusal is real evidence that
// the service is not up, while a probe we abort ourselves is evidence of
// nothing at all -- something accepted the connection, or this machine was too
// starved to schedule the answer inside the window we allowed. Charging both to
// the same budget let a live, healthy forwarder be declared dead under
// fork/exec contention.
//
// So the two outcomes are handled differently:
//   * refused  -> back off before retrying. Probes are free and the evidence is
//                 conclusive, so the only thing left to manage is the flood of
//                 access-log lines a cold-starting gateway would otherwise get.
//   * aborted  -> retry immediately with a wider window. The probe already
//                 spent its entire timeout waiting, which is backoff enough;
//                 sleeping on top of it only burns budget without learning
//                 anything, and the next probe needs to be *wider*, not later.
//
// The services also announce themselves on stderr ("[api-forwarder] listening"),
// which looks like corroborating evidence, but start.mjs spawns them with
// inherited stdio so that line goes straight to the service log and is not
// readable here without piping and re-forwarding every child's output. That
// would change log ordering for every service and risk a full pipe stalling a
// child, to learn something weaker than the probe already establishes:
// "listening" is not "healthy", and the router wait checks the payload too.
//
// One consequence of a bounded-but-wide window: the last probe of a budget can
// run past the deadline by up to its own window, so a service that accepts
// connections and never answers is reported up to MAX_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS late.
// That is the right trade -- the alternative is spending the tail of the budget
// on narrow probes that cannot conclude anything -- and a service that died is
// still reported sooner than it used to be, because the backoff sleep after the
// probe is cut short the moment the child exits.
