# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Startup now repairs drifted routed-agent definitions.** The post-health
  native-catalog reconciliation also compares Codex Router's managed agent
  files with the current routed-model, visibility, and subagent settings. A
  missing, stale, unprotected, or extra managed definition triggers the same
  locked picker republish even when native model metadata itself is unchanged.
  Foreign/unreadable Codex transport state remains write-free.
- **The dashboard 24H chart now covers the exact rolling 24-hour window.** The
  hourly rollup added in #644 aligned bars to clock hours but began at the
  next whole hour after `now - 24h`, dropping up to almost one hour of valid
  traffic. The router and legacy renderer fallback now retain both partial edge
  hours while filtering events to the exact half-open `[now - 24h, now)` window.
- **Command Code no longer rejects a routed turn over a long tool name or a
  recursive schema.** A Codex turn carrying a client tool such as
  `mcp__openai_api_key_local_confirmation__confirm_openai_api_key_local_destination`
  (80 characters) was refused before generation with ``HTTP 400: `name` must be
  at most 64 characters, got 80``, and the turn behind it then hit
  `Recursive JSON schemas are not currently supported` (issue #626).
  `chatProviderToolSurface()` now sends both `commandcode` and
  `commandcode-messages` through the router's existing bounded alias route at
  64 characters, and both variants join the non-recursive schema repair. The
  aliases stay deterministic and reversible, so a call the model makes under
  the bounded spelling is restored to the client's own tool identity. Every
  other non-Groq provider keeps its tool surface byte for byte.

- **The macOS tray no longer spawns a Node process every second to read
  health.** `refreshActivity()` polls health once a second and ran
  `bin/control health --json` each time, which boots Node and control.mjs's
  whole module graph to make one loopback GET: about a second of CPU per call,
  so an idle tray pegged a core for as long as it ran (measured 93.6% CPU,
  1450 ms wall and 1000 ms CPU per poll, against 1.4 ms for the same GET over
  plain HTTP). The tray now reads the protected health leaf directly with
  `URLSession`, behind the same caller key and the same 3 s timeout. It decodes
  every HTTP response, so a 503 still carries the degraded list and service
  rows; transport failures throw and are recorded exactly as a failed
  `control health` was. `control-health.mjs` remains the contract for the CLI
  and the Control Center. The bounded one-second polls during MLX install,
  runtime update, and vision-bridge pull still shell out and are unchanged.

- **Tok/s meter now excludes reasoning tokens and hides during generation.**
  `observedTokensPerSecond` used full `outputTokens` while TTFT waited for the
  first *visible* token. Providers often include `reasoning_tokens` (silent
  thinking) in `output_tokens`, inflating reported speed (~+24% measured on
  Muse Spark free: 502 output with 98 reasoning → 163.6 tok/s vs ~131.6 when
  reasoning excluded). `normalizeTokenUsage` now extracts `reasoningTokens`
  from `output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` /
  `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` / `reasoning_tokens` when
  present. `aggregateProviderUsage` and Control Center `tokensPerSecondFromEvent`
  subtract reasoning from the tok/s numerator to match industry TTFT on first
  visible token. Provider totals and billing still count full output. Panel and
  tray status chips now hide the measured median while generating, showing only
  "— tok/s" and "Appears after a metered reply" during active turns. Historical
  events without `reasoningTokens` are unchanged. Also fixes chat first-token
  detection: `chat.completion.chunk` often has no `type` field, so checking type
  before delta meant chat TTFT never fired and tray speed stayed null.

- **Startup prunes `enabled-providers.json` entries that cannot authenticate.**
  Unknown ids (version skew) and recognised providers without a credential
  were left in the selection file forever, so the dispatcher still treated
  them as enabled and answered `provider_api_key_missing`. Startup now
  rewrites the file to the configured subset (and deletes a file that named
  only unknown ids, preserving the no-file show-all fallback). Idempotent;
  discovery-disabled and show-all modes are left alone.
- **macOS KeepAlive no longer uses launchd `Adaptive`, which starved startup.**
  Adaptive only boosts on XPC transactions; the router is localhost HTTP, so
  the job stayed at Background. Node OAuth/API forwarders then missed the 30s
  health budget, `KeepAlive` restart-looped, and tray Update / doctor --fix
  waited 300s on `/health` and rolled the checkout back. The LaunchAgent now
  renders `ProcessType=Standard`. Do not revert to `Background` (LiteLLM
  starved to ~4% CPU in `fb40f8c`).
- **Grok OAuth post-tool turns no longer stay silent while their repair is
  certified.** The forwarder now opens a streamed Chat Completions response as
  soon as xAI returns its headers and relays reasoning immediately, while still
  withholding the short visible sentence that may be a progress-only stop.
  A certified retry supplies the final answer or tool call; an invalid repair
  ends the already-open stream with one terminal error and never emits
  `[DONE]`. Retry and failure logs now include per-attempt header, first-event,
  and total timings plus the safe `x-grok-req-id`, so upstream silence can be
  distinguished from router-side staging without logging prompt or output.

- **Routed reasoning models no longer leak `<think>` chains into the visible
  answer.** Qwen (and other reasoning models bridged through LiteLLM's
  chat-completions path) sometimes emit their chain-of-thought inline in the
  content channel as `<think>...</think>` instead of on the reasoning channel,
  so LiteLLM relays it as `output_text` and the answer renders behind the
  model's reasoning — or behind a bare `</think>` when the open tag is consumed
  upstream but the close is not. A new `ReasoningTagStripper` egress transform
  (`src/reasoning-tag-stripper.mjs`) removes `<think>...</think>` spans and
  orphan tags from the message text across the streamed `output_text.delta`s
  (buffering a tag split across deltas), the terminal `output_text.done`, and
  the stored message item. It covers the reasoning-delimiter family the model
  varies to (`think`/`thinking`/`reason`/`reasoning`), leaves the structured
  reasoning channel and every non-message item untouched, and passes clean
  answers through unchanged. Routed providers only.

- **Routed turns that mix assistant text and a tool call no longer render
  twice.** LiteLLM's chat-completions-to-Responses bridge
  (`use_chat_completions_api`) could leave the assistant `message` item open
  across a `function_call` item and emit its `output_item.done` late, so Codex
  committed the streamed text once while it was live and again when the delayed
  close arrived — the same sentence appeared twice, with the tool call after it.
  It surfaced intermittently on qwen-plan turns that both speak and call a tool.
  A new `ItemLifecycleNormalizer` egress transform (`src/item-lifecycle-normalizer.mjs`),
  added last in the routed-provider response pipeline, holds events for a
  newly-opened output item until the currently-open item closes, restoring the
  Responses contract that every item is `done` before the next
  `output_item.added`. It reorders only — no event body is added, dropped, or
  rewritten — and engages only when the upstream actually interleaves; clean
  streams and native OpenAI streams pass through unchanged.

- **A Grok OAuth outage now terminates streamed Codex turns instead of leaving
  a stale Working badge.** After the local gateway has exhausted its bounded
  retries, a final Grok 5xx on an explicitly streamed Responses request is
  returned as one terminal SSE `error` event. Non-streaming Grok calls,
  actionable 4xx failures, and every other provider retain their HTTP status
  and JSON body, while usage metering still records Grok's real failure status.

- **Empty `tools: []` is now stripped for all API-forwarder routes, not only
  `qwen38-community`.** Strict upstreams (vLLM >=0.20 Pydantic) refuse an empty
  tools array. Codex sends `tools: []` on compaction and plain chat, so without
  this strip every compaction against strict providers 400s. The repair was
  previously applied only to the `qwen38-community` profile; it is now applied
  to all routes so compaction and plain chat work against any strict provider.
  Dangling `tool_choice` is dropped only after stripping an empty `tools: []`
  array (not when tools was never present). The `qwen38-community` profile
  additionally drops tool_choice when tools is absent, as that endpoint refuses
  "When using `tool_choice`, `tools` must be set". Real non-empty tool arrays
  and their tool_choice are forwarded unchanged. (Fixes #588)
- **Grok OAuth reasoning summaries now appear in Codex while the model is
  thinking.** LiteLLM can open an empty assistant message before Grok's first
  reasoning delta, then assign a different item id to every delta and return
  the terminal reasoning item in Chat Completions shape. Codex discarded that
  orphaned lifecycle and showed no progress until answer text arrived. The
  router now repairs only Grok OAuth event streams into one canonical Responses
  reasoning item, preserves valid streams, and keeps the following message and
  tool output indexes consistent.

- **A `Retry-After` expressed as a date is now honored.** RFC 9110 allows
  `Retry-After` to carry either delay-seconds or an HTTP-date. The router read
  the header as a bare number, so a dated value became `NaN` and every consumer
  discarded it: a burst 429 that named its own window did not qualify for
  failover, no provider cooldown was recorded, and the translated error lost
  its "retry in about Ns" hint. The turn therefore died on a provider that had
  said exactly when it would be back, and each later turn paid the same refusal
  again for the length of the window. The header now goes through the same
  `resetAt` parser the `x-ratelimit-*` snapshot already used, which reads
  delay-seconds, an HTTP-date, and a Go-style duration alike, and
  `api-forwarder`'s private copy of that conversion is gone in favor of the
  shared one, so there is one place the header is read.
- **A 429 that named no wait no longer advises retrying "in about 0s".**
  `headers.get` answers null for a header that was never sent and
  `Number(null)` is `0` — a finite value, so the rate-limit message quoted a
  zero-second wait as though the provider had asked for one. Absence and an
  unparseable value now read as no window at all, while a delay of `0` (which
  RFC 9110 permits) and a date that has already passed are kept as the zero
  they are, because a provider saying "now" is not a provider saying nothing.
  Only a positive wait is worth wording, so both zeroes reach the operator as
  "Wait a bit and retry."
- **Pin Gemini 3.8 Flash, Muse Spark 1.3, Claude Fable 5.1, and additional
  models across providers.** Confirmed routes 2026-09-03: Gemini 3.8 Flash on
  OpenRouter, Command Code, Nous Research, and Venice; Muse Spark 1.3 and 1.3
  Contributor on OpenRouter, Nous Research, and opencode Go Responses; Claude
  Fable 5.1 on OpenRouter, Command Code Messages, Nous Research, and Venice;
  Command Code Qwen3.8 Max 0902 and GLM-5.3-Flash; opencode Go Messages
  Qwen3.8 Flash. No new `multiAgentVersion: "v2"` stamps. Updated Command Code
  curation allowlists for the new Chat and Messages ids.
- **OpenCode Free Responses now lists Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor Free.** The
  anonymous Zen Responses route now includes both `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free`
  and `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`. Same documented exception: no API key
  needed, but the free catalog can vanish and Meta may train on these turns.
- **Qwen Plan collaboration calls are now restored to namespaced shape.** Qwen
  Plan (Alibaba Model Studio Token Plan) returns Codex v1 collaboration calls
  as pre-flattened names (`multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` with no namespace),
  which Codex Desktop rejects. The Responses adapter now rebuilds the namespace
  from flattened tool names that came from actual `type: "namespace"` entries or
  from known collaboration namespaces (`multi_agent_v1`, `collaboration`), so
  Desktop receives `spawn_agent` in the `multi_agent_v1` namespace instead.
  MCP-style names like `mcp__node_repl__js` are left unchanged unless they came
  from a real namespace tool, avoiding false restoration of tools that happen to
  contain `__` (#568).
- **An exhausted opencode Go plan no longer withdraws opencode Zen, or the
  reverse.** Provider cooldowns were keyed by the canonical provider id, which
  is the right identity for a protocol variant — opencode's Messages and
  Responses routes are one subscription behind two wire formats, so one being
  empty means all of them are. Zen is the exception the code already names in
  `cooldownScope`: it shares Go's credential and selection toggle but is billed
  separately at its own endpoint. Filing both windows under the parent meant a
  closed Go plan silently answered a Zen turn from a different provider
  (`reason=cooled_until_...`), and an exhausted Zen balance withdrew the whole
  Go subscription — in both directions a paid route taken away for a window its
  provider never named for it. Windows are now keyed by cooldown scope
  wherever they are recorded, read, cleared, or ranked — including the vision
  bridge's engine selection, which read a window its own writer files under a
  different key — and `api-forwarder` passes the provider id through
  unresolved so the scope is decided in one place. Protocol variants still
  share a window, which is what the existing family test holds.
- **The Windows Control Center no longer flashes PowerShell windows.** A console
  process spawned by a parent that has no console of its own — the Electron
  Control Center and the tray — gets its own window unless `windowsHide` is set,
  and four background helpers were missing it. The one every private write
  reaches meant a burst of visible windows on each status refresh, which is why
  it showed up on every message sent (#565). The private-file ACL writer and its
  verifier, scheduled-task registration, and the tray's task-state poll now all
  hide. Interactive prompts are untouched: they inherit a console the operator is
  already looking at, and hiding it would ask for input through a window nobody
  can see. A source-level test holds the line, since the failure is invisible off
  Windows.
- **A failed Windows scheduled-task launch now explains itself.** Node reports a
  module it cannot *read* exactly as it reports one that is not there —
  `Cannot find module` with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` — so an install whose checkout
  the task's own token cannot read looked like a missing `src\start.mjs` that
  the operator could open in front of them (#548). Readiness failure now checks
  whether the path the loader named exists: if it does, it reports a permission
  or token problem and how to confirm it, and if it does not, it reports an
  incomplete checkout. When the log carries no such evidence the original
  wording is kept rather than a cause being invented. This improves the
  diagnosis only; the underlying ACL condition is not yet reproduced.
- **The Codex picker now shows vendor groups.** Codex sorts its model picker by
  each entry's `priority`, never by catalog order, and routed models reused
  the same low integers as native GPT entries, so DeepSeek and Grok routes
  interleaved with GPT models and the vendor grouping the catalog always
  carried never reached the screen (#544). Routed models that are not
  certified v2 spawn routes are now published in a band above the highest
  visible native priority, in vendor-group order. A certified v2 route keeps
  its authored priority, because that value is what keeps it inside Codex's
  small spawn-model override window; renumbering it would crowd it out. Only
  the published entry changes: failover ranking, the vision bridge, and every
  other client keep reading the registry's authored value.
- **Grok OAuth no longer replays a known progress-only sentence after an
  aborted follow-up.** The first affected turn remains fully live. Once a
  conversation has actually produced the progress-only shape, later
  user-message turns buffer only a short visible prefix while leaving the
  response head and preceding reasoning live. A real tool call or longer
  answer releases that prefix immediately; an upstream abort reports its terminal
  stream error without first committing the same status sentence to Codex
  again. Evidence is retained in a bounded in-memory conversation set.

- **Request bodies are decompressed off the event loop, and an oversize zstd
  frame is refused from its header.** Codex zstd-compresses every request, so
  the router inflated a buffer that grows with the conversation on the thread
  serving every other request, through the one-shot synchronous decoder. That
  path is the one implicated in an intermittent native abort on Windows
  (#465: exit `0xC0000409` with no JavaScript frame, always late in a long
  session, always right after a successful turn), which took every listener
  down with it. The router now reads the size a Zstandard frame declares and
  answers 413 before any native decoder runs when it exceeds the decode cap,
  and inflates everything else through the asynchronous decoder under the same
  cap. The crash has not been reproduced outside Windows, so this is
  defensive hardening rather than a confirmed fix; the issue stays open for a
  crash dump.
- **Antigravity OAuth now uses an operator-owned, fail-closed sign-in.** The
  router requires one matching Google Desktop-app client ID/secret pair,
  collects it through an ephemeral IPv4 loopback listener, and stores the pair
  privately with the refresh session on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It no longer
  borrows the official `agy`/IDE credential or identity, copies a secret into
  service definitions, or provisions a project during sign-in. The route stays
  disabled until a separately confirmed, quota-consuming live probe succeeds
  with the truthful `codex-router` identity; incompatible legacy records are
  preserved until the operator explicitly disconnects them. Its forwarder is
  not spawned or health-gated before proof. A passing probe is persisted as a
  generation-bound pending activation that remains unpublishable until the
  restarted local stack is fully healthy; failed startup, process death,
  credential replacement, and disconnect cannot promote it. Thus an unused
  provider port cannot take down the router or leave an unready route exposed.
  Pre-activation v2 proof records are deliberately unverified and require a
  fresh explicit probe rather than being grandfathered past this readiness gate.
  An authorization-code `invalid_client` rejection also tombstones only the
  exact credential-and-proof snapshot submitted with that same client pair;
  concurrent replacements and unrelated attempted clients remain untouched.
  The Control Center gives the live request, restart readiness, exact-generation
  confirmation, and client publication one shared ten-minute deadline, with a
  separate one-minute command-runner cleanup margin, so a wedged command tree
  can be terminated without shortening the cooperative activation budget. On
  Windows, bounded children start suspended in a kill-on-close Job Object, get
  only dedicated standard handles through an explicit inheritance allowlist,
  and remain attached to the console for interactive operations; restricted
  PowerShell hosts fail before launching the mutation.

- **Support bundles now always omit historical logs.** A log may contain a
  credential that was later rotated or deleted, so current-secret discovery
  cannot prove any historical tail safe. Bundles retain redacted generated
  diagnostics and log-file metadata without copying arbitrary log contents;
  the former `--include-logs` switch remains accepted as a deprecated no-op.
- **OpenClaw is now a one-click routed client.** The Harness page can install
  the official `openclaw@latest` package when it is missing and publish every
  selected router model through a private `codex-router` Responses provider.
  The integration preserves unrelated OpenClaw config and user-selected
  defaults, participates in shared catalog refresh and caller-key rotation,
  and is available as `--target openclaw` on POSIX and Windows.

- **Muse Spark 1.2 Contributor no longer fails on recursive Codex tool
  schemas through OpenCode Go.** Console Go rejects the whole Responses turn
  before inference when this model receives a recursive local JSON-Schema
  reference. The router now breaks only cycle-closing reference edges for the
  paid Muse route, preserving definitions, acyclic references, and sibling
  constraints. Other Console Go Responses models retain their existing schema
  payloads until they demonstrate the same restriction.

- **OpenCode Console Go chat models no longer reject ambient hosted-search
  options.** Codex can attach `web_search_options` even when the selected
  OpenCode Go model does not advertise hosted search; Console Go forwards the
  unknown field to its strict Chat Completions backend, which rejects the
  entire turn with HTTP 400. The router now removes only that unsupported
  option for the `opencode-go` provider on ordinary and compaction requests,
  with the API forwarder enforcing the same boundary. Other search payloads
  and providers that accept the option remain unchanged.

- **Strict generic providers no longer receive unadvertised hosted-search
  extensions.** Codex may attach `web_search`, `web_search_preview`,
  `web_search_options`, and search-only `include` entries even when the chosen
  routed model does not advertise search. The router now removes only those
  hosted-search artifacts at its managed Responses boundary for unsupported
  runtime-generic routes, while preserving ordinary functions (including one
  named `web_search`), capable models, and direct gateway traffic. An explicit
  request that can no longer satisfy `tool_choice` fails locally with a named
  400 instead of reaching a strict upstream as an ambiguous request. Failover
  also preserves the source model's hosted-versus-standalone search mode for
  search-capable turns and refuses to guess after search history exists.

- **Reinstalling over a state directory owned by another checkout no longer
  deadlocks.** The installers recorded the state directory's new owner only
  after the background service reported healthy, while the service itself
  refuses to boot for as long as the record still names another checkout
  (`foreign_state_owner`): an install that followed one from a different
  checkout crash-looped for the full 300-second readiness budget, rolled
  back, and repeated on every retry, and deleting the whole state directory
  -- every stored provider key with it -- was the only escape. The record now
  precedes the service step it describes, so the service boots against its
  own ownership. The ownership override the installers run under is scoped
  to that full, ownership-transferring install on both platforms: a
  prepare-only run meets the guard like any other writer (and the Windows
  installer restores the caller's environment when it finishes). Linux
  readiness also fails fast once the service manager's restart counter shows
  a crash loop, instead of waiting out the whole budget, and names the
  journal and the router log in the error; the counter query itself is
  killed inside a bounded slice of the remaining budget, so a blocked
  `systemctl` cannot stretch the wait, and a health answer that lands as the
  threshold is crossed still wins over the crash-loop verdict.

- **OpenCode Go Kimi K2.7 Code now accepts current Codex tool schemas.** Its
  Moonshot-backed validator receives the same bounded decorated-`$defs` repair
  as the first-party Kimi routes. The compatibility gate names only this
  observed Console Go model, so unrelated OpenCode Go routes keep their tool
  payloads unchanged.

- **Translated tool streams no longer expose bridge-only assistant turns.**
  Bounded, fail-open normalization removes only empty assistant envelopes that
  LiteLLM's Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages bridges corroborate with a
  completed tool lifecycle, then compacts the affected output indexes. Real
  text, reasoning, refusals, malformed or ambiguous streams, and native
  Responses routes remain untouched. Non-streaming bodies receive equivalent
  bounded, fail-open handling under an exact terminal-output proof. Direct
  DeepSeek keeps its narrower provider-specific proof: the historical
  no-prelude bridge drops its corroborated private-reasoning blank, while the
  current bridge reconstructs candidate-attached reasoning under the terminal
  reasoning ID and removes only the separately corroborated blank output.

- **Live model certification now proves the requested route.** Compatibility
  and smoke probes disable router failover, so a healthy alternate can no
  longer certify a broken preset. Direct probes retained GLM-5.3-Flash on
  OpenCode Go, OpenRouter, and Z.ai Coding; the unproved Command Code, Nous
  Research, and Venice Flash presets were withdrawn. Command Code's Ox Alpha
  id returned `model_unavailable` on every exact surface, while the available
  Venice account was billing-blocked before its Ox route could be certified,
  so neither Ox preset ships. Provider discovery remains available for explicit
  per-machine curation without presenting catalog presence as wire proof.
  Curated models now inherit a request profile only when every checked-in route
  in that provider family has the same non-empty profile, so a model-specific
  repair such as OpenRouter Flash's `ox-alpha` profile cannot leak onto an
  unrelated model selected from the same catalog.

- **Router retention and concurrency now stay bounded without crossing native accounts.**
  Request bodies and buffered upstream errors have explicit byte ceilings,
  active turns retain truthful accounting after tray records expire, and a
  separate 24-hour execution deadline protects abandoned work. Encrypted
  collaboration relays coalesce only within the same resolved native account;
  one canceled waiter cannot stop another, while the shared read is aborted
  when every waiter leaves. Aggregate limits and cache counters are visible
  only through caller-authenticated health.

- **Qwen3.8 Flash and GLM-5.3 full are now pinned on listed providers.**
  Live catalogs confirmed 2026-08-27: OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3.8-flash` and
  `z-ai/glm-5.3`; Command Code `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash` and `zai-org/GLM-5.3`;
  QwenCloud/DashScope `qwen3.8-flash`; Nous Research `qwen/qwen3.8-flash`;
  Venice `z-ai-glm-5-3`; Z.ai API `glm-5.3-flash`. GLM-5.3-Flash was already
  shipped in #466; this adds the full GLM-5.3 on OpenRouter, Command Code, and
  Venice, plus Qwen3.8 Flash on OpenRouter, Command Code, Nous Research, and
  Qwen Plan, plus GLM-5.3-Flash on zai-api.

- **OpenCode Go's Ox Alpha preview has graduated to GLM-5.3-Flash.** The
  authenticated catalog now publishes `glm-5.3-flash` and reports the old
  `ox-alpha-free` ID unavailable, matching OpenCode's current Chat Completions
  table and Z.ai's reveal. The picker now exposes
  `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash` as the named, metered 1M-context multimodal model;
  existing `opencode-go/ox-alpha` and locally curated
  `opencode-go/ox-alpha-free` selections migrate through static aliases,
  and the preview's measured low/high/max effort normalization remains attached
  to the named route. Codex now compacts this route conservatively at 400K after
  large live multimodal histories returned empty completions before the generic
  85% point of its advertised 1M window.

- **OpenRouter now ships Grok 4.6 as a listed route.** The checked-in pin is
  `openrouter/grok-4.6`, upstream id `x-ai/grok-4.6`, 500,000 context with
  auto-compact at 440,000, text+image input, and the low/medium/high reasoning
  ladder (matching Command Code, not Nous Research's xhigh-ladder route).

- **README: Ox Alpha availability updated.** No checked-in Ox Alpha preset
  remains. The withdrawn OpenCode Free, OpenRouter, and Nous routes are gone;
  Command Code directly reported its id unavailable, and Venice could not be
  wire-certified through the available account's billing gate. OpenCode Go,
  OpenRouter, and Z.ai Coding retain their direct-proven named
  GLM-5.3-Flash routes.

## 0.5.0

- **Grok 4.6 ships on opencode Go.** OpenCode's current Go list and endpoint
  table publish `grok-4.6` on `/zen/go/v1/responses` (not chat, not messages).
  The checked-in route is `opencode-go-responses/grok-4.6`, 500,000 context
  with auto-compact at 440,000, text+image, and the low/medium/high/xhigh
  ladder models.dev publishes for this id, defaulting to high. No Free twin
  exists. Grok 4.5 stays on the same Responses variant.

- **Nous Research now lists ~27 new models including Hermes 4, free portal
  routes, and coding flagships.** The checked-in registry adds
  `nousresearch/hermes-4-405b` and `nousresearch/hermes-4-70b`, six free-tier
  routes (`longcat-2.0-free`, `laguna-s-2.1-free`, `laguna-xs-2.1-free`,
  `step-3.7-flash-free`, `hy3-free`, `solar-pro4-free`) tagged Free in the Models
  page, plus coding flagships (DeepSeek V4, Kimi K3, Qwen 3.8/3.7 Max, GLM-5.3/5.2,
  MiniMax M3, Claude Opus/Sonnet/Fable 5, GPT-5.6 Terra, Gemini 3.7 Flash, Grok 4.6,
  and others). 28 listed models total including the existing `ox-alpha`. Routing
  still requires a Nous Portal API key (the `:free` ids are billed through the
  portal credential, not anonymous like OpenCode Free). This is not the full
  372-model catalog.
- **Subagent selection is honoured again.** `applyMultiAgentSettings` only ever
  demoted: it read `disabled` and `hidden` and nothing else, so the three modes
  documented in `.claude/skills/codex-subagents/SKILL.md` — `proven`,
  `selected`, `all` — were inert and every selection an operator had made was
  silently discarded. An install running `mode: selected` with twenty routes
  enabled had four spawnable and one agent definition on disk, while
  `subagents status` cheerfully reported the twenty. The modes work as
  documented again: an explicit `off` still beats every mode, a hidden model is
  never promoted, and only an explicit choice promotes — a machine-local probe
  still promotes nothing on its own. **On upgrade this changes what Codex is
  offered**: an install sitting on `mode: all`, or on `selected` with a stale
  `enabled` list, will advertise those routes as subagents again, which is what
  the setting always said it would do. `mode all` remains "every non-hidden
  model, regardless of whether it works" — verify a route with the agent check
  before relying on it (PR #439).

- **Running the test suite no longer clears the operator's subagent
  definitions.** Four tests in `test/control.test.mjs` pointed
  `MODEL_ROUTER_STATE_DIR` at a temporary directory but left `CODEX_HOME`
  alone. `subagents set` republishes the catalog, and the agent definitions it
  writes are keyed off `CODEX_HOME`, so every `npm test` emptied
  `~/.codex/agents` on the machine running it — seventeen definitions before,
  none after, restored by the next publish, with a doctor `FAIL` as the only
  trace. The publish that clears them also says so now, rather than emptying
  the directory in silence (PR #439).

- **A provider reachable only through the proxy no longer reads as a broken
  one.** The Control Center is launched by the desktop session, so it inherits
  `HTTP_PROXY` from the login environment but nothing telling Node it may use
  it — the address and the permission to use it are separate answers. A
  discovery child then dialled the provider directly and its connect timeout
  was reported as the provider failing, which is how a reachable Venice catalog
  came back as `fetch failed`. Children spawned by the app now read the opt-in
  the install manifest recorded, and only for the install that recorded it;
  only the opt-in is restored, never an address (PR #439).

- **The Models page is one list.** Two sections both changed what ended up in
  the picker, six words described three concepts, and a row jumped to a
  different group the moment its switch was flipped. Provider accounts collapse
  into a connections strip, one **Add models** dialog searches every connected
  catalog, and row order no longer depends on the switches. The Subagents
  column stopped offering a compatibility test that could not enable anything —
  turning the switch on now selects the route and the router publishes it, one
  click from off to spawnable. `docs/SUBAGENT-CERTIFICATION.md` records what
  the five-check certification can and cannot establish, including that checks
  3-5 cannot complete while Codex is signed in with a ChatGPT account, so the
  next reader does not spend provider quota re-learning it (PR #439).

- **Windows startup now fails fast when the scheduled task is dead instead of
  polling health for its whole budget.** Task Scheduler can keep a stale
  instance entry (or a Running state) after the launcher tree behind it has
  died, so `service start` used to spend its entire readiness timeout waiting
  for a router that nothing would ever start (issue #384, PR #387). Readiness
  now reads the task from two places — the COM instance enumeration, and a
  direct scan for a live process whose command line references the generated
  launcher — and once both stop reporting a live launch for longer than a short
  grace, fails with the task's own `LastTaskResult` instead of a generic
  timeout. A task-state query failure is inconclusive and never fails the wait
  by itself, so a restricted shell still receives the full health budget rather
  than a false failure. The health answer itself is normalized to one contract
  before the guard trusts it — healthy only when the router actually answered,
  whether the probe resolves or rejects — and a Windows interpreter probe that
  merely times out under process-launch contention, which is not evidence of a
  broken virtual environment, is retried once with a wider bound before install
  reports a condition that was transient all along.

- **ChatGPT subscription access for non-Codex clients is now an explicit,
  one-time local authorization.** A discovered Codex `auth.json` no longer
  silently lets DeepSeek Harness, Gemini CLI, or another caller-key client
  spend the account. After `codex login`, the user runs `model-router codex
  chatgpt-session enable` once; an owner-only, credential-free marker applies
  that decision to every client on the shared loopback router plane. Disabling
  it revokes native GPT publication everywhere without signing Codex out. A
  missing or malformed authorization and a missing or expired session both
  fail closed. External model routes and Codex's own session pass-through are
  unchanged.

- **Ox Alpha initially shipped on six routes.** The stealth 1M-context reasoning model was
  checked in for `opencode-free` (no key), `opencode-go`, `openrouter`,
  `commandcode`, `nousresearch`, and `venice`, each under the upstream id that
  provider's own live catalog publishes. All six advertise 1,048,576 tokens
  with 131,072 of output, text+image input, and a low/high/max effort ladder
  defaulting to max — the model always thinks, and its upstream refuses any
  other rung by name ("please use low, high, or max"). Venice's catalog
  advertises a fourth rung the model rejects; the model wins, and the
  disagreement is written down rather than silently resolved. A new `ox-alpha`
  request profile clamps the requested effort onto those three rungs, which is
  load-bearing rather than defensive: a Codex older than 0.143 has no `max` in
  its enum, so the catalog sends the clamped `xhigh` and every turn would
  otherwise 400. Only the credential-free route carries curated announcement
  copy; the other five used the automatic announcement once their provider was
  credentialed.

- **Venice and Nous Research (Hermes) are new API-key providers.** Both are
  selectable through `install.sh --providers`, `providers enable`, and the
  tray, both ship a provider mark, and both are covered by `doctor`. Venice
  carries a plan note because a free Venice account has no API entitlement at
  all — API access needs a Pro subscription, a funded USD balance, or staked
  VVV that grants VCU.

- **The tray and control center show what these subscriptions have left.**
  Venice's `api_keys/rate_limits` route is wired into `provider-usage`, so the
  tray reports all three pools that can fund a request (USD, VCU, and the daily
  DIEM allowance) plus the API tier, instead of showing a zero to someone whose
  VCU balance is full. OpenRouter now reports its per-key spend cap from
  `/api/v1/key`, adding the account-wide credit pool when the stored key is a
  management key and keeping the per-key numbers when it is not. Nous Portal
  publishes no credits route at all, so it degrades to its subscription page
  and observed router traffic rather than inventing a number.

- **Private state files are hardened with a canonical owner-only ACL on
  Windows.** The previous Windows path asked `GetAccessControl` about the
  file's existing DACL and then edited it with `SetAccessRuleProtection` and
  `RemoveAccessRuleSpecific`, so a file whose DACL was already non-canonical
  could make it throw (or silently keep foreign ACEs), the exact drift an
  install or `doctor --fix` is meant to repair. Windows hardening now builds a
  fresh, empty `FileSecurity`, replaces the DACL outright with a single
  current-identity FullControl Allow rule and inheritance cleared, and skips
  persisting owner/group so it needs only `WRITE_DAC` and cannot fail where an
  `icacls /inheritance:r /grant:r` path would have succeeded. A hardening
  failure now exits non-zero with the PowerShell diagnosis on stderr instead of
  masquerading as success.

- **MiniMax M3 no longer shows its chain of thought as assistant text.** The
  Token Plan route asked for adaptive thinking but not `reasoning_split`, so
  MiniMax embedded the reasoning in `content` as literal `<think>...</think>`
  markup, which every client that does not know the vendor format rendered as
  ordinary output. Requesting the split moves it to `reasoning_content`, which
  this router already relays as reasoning. Verified against api.minimax.io: the
  same prompt leaks `<think>` into `content` without the flag and carries a
  populated `reasoning_content` with it. Reported in #333 by @moryk87.

- **The harness caller key is written where a current harness reads it.**
  DeepSeek Harness moved `.credentials.yaml` to a `version`/`refs` envelope
  around the reference map, and the router only knew the flat root map the
  older builds used -- so on a current harness it wrote `CODEX_ROUTER_CALLER_KEY`
  one level too high, the harness resolved the route's `apiKeyEnv` under `refs`,
  found nothing, and every turn came back 401 with no diagnostic anywhere
  (reported in #351 by @jepgambardella). Both shapes are now written in place,
  and neither is converted into the other: `refs` present settles it, `version`
  without `refs` settles it the other way -- that is a current harness on its
  first install, the case where guessing wrong is silent -- and a document with
  no references at all adopts the current shape. A new reference follows the
  indentation the envelope already uses for its siblings rather than assuming
  two spaces, since a mixed-indent block is not YAML any parser reads back and
  the file holds every adapter's key, not only ours. Removing the reference
  prunes a `refs:` it emptied, exactly as removing the route prunes an emptied
  `providers:`, so uninstall restores the document byte for byte. `status`
  resolves the credential through the same decision the writer makes, so it can
  no longer report one the harness cannot read. A reference an older build left
  at the root of an enveloped document is moved rather than copied, so uninstall
  no longer leaves a second copy of the caller key behind. Anything that is not
  a reference map in either shape -- a nested mapping at the root, a nested
  mapping inside `refs`, an inline `refs` -- is still refused with the file
  untouched.

- **The Grok OAuth forwarder is health-checked, and a dependency the router
  did not name is no longer reported as unknown.** `/health` probed the Kimi
  OAuth forwarder, the API forwarder, and the gateway, but never the Grok
  OAuth forwarder on its own port -- so an operator routing through Grok OAuth
  got no signal for it at all and the router could answer `ok` with that
  forwarder dead (issue #366). It is now probed like the others, gated on the
  `grok-oauth` provider actually being selected so an unused port is never
  dialled, named as `grokOauth` in `degraded` when it is down, and carried
  through the redacted health projection into the tray and the Control Center,
  which both render it beside the other forwarders. Separately, both surfaces
  fell through to "Unknown / Waiting for health report" whenever a service key
  was simply absent from the payload; a router that reported `ok` has already
  probed every dependency it knows about, so an id missing from `degraded` now
  renders Ready and a healthy install stops looking like it never answered.

- **Curated OpenCode Zen free models now ship the effort ladder and context
  window OpenCode publishes for them, and say which values are still
  guesses.** Zen's anonymous `/models` endpoint returns ids and nothing else,
  and the deterministic curation path is never interactive, so every free
  model landed in the picker with a generic 131,072-token window and a single
  `high` effort no matter what the route actually supported (#352).
  `src/opencode-curation.mjs` now carries OpenCode's own published `limit` and
  `reasoning_options` per *free id* -- adding real windows for
  `nemotron-3-ultra-free` (1,000,000) and `laguna-s-2.1-free` (256,000)
  alongside the two that already had them, and real effort ladders for
  `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free`, `x-preview-f-free`,
  `laguna-s-2.1-free`, `deepseek-v4-flash-free`, and `hy3-free`. A window is
  declared only when curation's 0.85 auto-compact ratio still reserves that
  id's published output limit, so compaction fires before a completion can
  overrun the window the entry just declared; `deepseek-v4-flash-free`,
  `hy3-free`, `mimo-v2.5-free`, and `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` therefore
  keep the conservative default rather than a number a full-length answer
  could walk off the end of. Each entry's description now names the provenance
  of every capability it carries *and* the ones that stayed unknown, so a
  reader can tell a documented value from a default without leaving the file.
  Hand-tuned entries are still never rewritten: the upgrade path touches only
  an entry still holding the untouched generic sizing pair and the untouched
  single-`high` ladder, and an explicit `--efforts` always wins.

- **Kimi OAuth sessions survive the Codex App connector pack.** Moonshot
  accepts a tool-schema `$ref` only when it points into `#/$defs/` and rejects
  the whole request -- not the one tool -- over anything else, so the
  sibling-property pointers connector tools ship (Wego `_flights_search` points
  `inboundTotalDurationRange` at its own sibling `priceRange`) turned every
  `kimi-oauth` App session into an HTTP 400 on its first message (issue #353).
  The relay now inlines those pointers for the kimi route: the node is replaced
  by the schema the client itself pointed at, with any constraint declared
  beside the `$ref` still winning, and `#/$defs/` pointers left exactly as they
  are. A pointer that cannot be resolved is left alone rather than guessed at,
  a cyclic schema stops at the edge that would close the cycle, and an
  expansion that outgrows its byte budget falls back to the original schema
  rather than shipping a duplicated one. Every other provider keeps the payload
  it gets today -- the inlining is scoped to the provider the rejection was
  reproduced on.

- **The macOS tray can load a provider's current model list and curate from
  it.** A new Provider catalogs panel asks any configured provider that
  supports live discovery for the models it serves right now, marks the ones
  already routed, and adds a selection through the same `curate-models.mjs`
  path the desktop app uses -- so the tray no longer has to hand people back
  to a terminal to pick up a model their provider shipped after install. The
  first open is answered from the router's stored list, so it costs no round
  trip and works offline; only Reload re-asks upstream. Model ids coming back
  from a provider are held to the same slug rule the Electron app enforces
  before any of them reaches curation, and every discovery or curation run is
  bounded by the Electron timeouts, so a provider that accepts the connection
  and never answers can no longer wedge the panel's buttons for the rest of
  the session. The panel is translated in all six tray languages.

- **An update no longer empties the picker on a pre-allowlist install.** The
  routed picker became an allowlist in `v0.4.0-beta.4`; on an install written
  by an older build, every routed model was absent from `seeded` rather than
  recorded as visible, so the first catalog rebuild read "on, but never
  written down" as "never decided" and applied the opt-in default to models
  that were plainly already showing (issue #338). The catalog build now
  migrates that file once, before the default runs: a routed slug in neither
  `hidden` nor `seeded` is recorded visible, so the picker the operator was
  looking at survives the update. Models switched off on purpose stay off, and
  a fresh install still opts in model by model.

  **If an update already hid your models,** the migration cannot tell them
  apart from a deliberate hide -- both now sit in `hidden` and `seeded` -- and
  deliberately does not guess. Restore a provider's models with the picker
  command, which republishes the catalog on the way out:

  ```sh
  ./bin/control picker provider opencode-go show
  ```

  Substitute your provider ID (`./bin/model-router codex providers list --json`
  lists them), repeat per provider, then fully quit and reopen Codex.

- **Guided setup asks which models go in the picker.** `./bin/setup --guided`
  now has a model step between choosing providers and connecting credentials.
  It starts from the picker the machine already has -- nothing on a first
  install, the operator's existing selection on a re-run -- so enabling a
  provider still offers its models rather than choosing them, and pressing
  Enter through the step never changes what is already there. The selection is
  written after the "Proceed?" confirmation, so a cancelled setup and a
  `--selection-only` run both leave `model-picker.json` untouched, and it
  records `hidden`/`seeded` rather than an allowlist on a pre-allowlist file,
  because one screen of models cannot answer for the providers it never
  showed.

- **Concurrent Codex turns no longer stall `/health` and the next request.**
  Loopback liveliness probes use a separate dispatcher so they cannot queue
  behind long-lived SSE sockets, and `/health` serves a recent probe result
  immediately while a slow LiteLLM liveliness check refreshes in the
  background. The snapshot is still bounded: once it is older than 15s the
  next `/health` waits for a live probe, so a tray-less `doctor` cannot
  inherit an hours-old "reachable". Probe GETs use undici's own `fetch` with
  that extra Agent (Node's builtin `fetch` rejects an npm-undici dispatcher)
  and the same `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` selection as routed traffic. The
  process-wide HTTP/1.1 pool stays unbounded -- a numeric `connections` cap
  would queue later turns across every installed client. Disconnect handlers
  are registered before the `JSON.parse` yield so a canceled turn cannot
  start an upstream fetch. The tray was reporting Starting and Codex
  "waiting for network" with two or three in-flight turns even though the
  router was still generating.

- **Homebrew installs can reach every command again.** The formula's PATH shim
  exec'd `bin/model-router codex`, whose fixed whitelist has no entry for
  `curate-models`, `discover-models`, `refresh-catalog`, `test-model`,
  `support-bundle`, or `control` -- so a packaged user had no way to add a
  custom provider's models, and a bare `codex-router` or `codex-router --help`
  printed `model-router`'s usage instead of the packaged command list. The shim
  now dispatches through `bin/codex-router`, which exists for exactly this
  case. `post_install` gets its own private entry point, because
  `bin/codex-router` refuses `install` by design. Reported in #334.

- **GLM-5.3 on opencode Go serves its real 1M context.** The entry still
  carried 200,000/180,000 -- the GLM-5.1 lineage default that #244 established
  is wrong for 5.3, where a live probe accepted 990,020 prompt tokens. Both
  Z.ai GLM-5.3 entries were corrected then; this opencode Go entry was missed,
  so a session was compacting at 180K against a model that serves a million.
  Its GLM-5.1 and GLM-5.2 siblings on the same gateway already declare
  1,048,576, so 1,000,000/900,000 stays conservative against the relay.
  Standalone web search stays off for this route until the opencode Go relay
  is verified to preserve tool/function-call history.
- **External-model compaction now carries evidence-backed `kcr2`
  checkpoints.** The router assigns stable `U/C/R/A` source IDs before tool
  results are aged, accepts only a bounded structured source selection from the
  summarizing model, and derives the trusted section from redacted original
  excerpts and machine-readable tool outcomes. Model prose remains explicitly
  unverified; missing, fabricated, or misclassified references are rejected;
  unresolved unknowns survive repeated compaction; and replay tells the next
  model to re-read mutable state before changing it. New checkpoints are capped
  at 96 KiB after final JSON serialization, with a 32 KiB recent tail. Existing
  source IDs and counters are rejected unless they are positive safe integers;
  the source catalog sent to the model has its own 96 KiB JSON limit, and only
  IDs actually present in that catalog can be selected. Wrapped provider output
  is accepted only when it contains exactly one contract-valid JSON object and
  is no larger than 256 KiB. The latest two user messages are reserved in both
  the source catalog and recent tail. The v1 compact endpoint now replays at
  most those two complete ordinary user messages before the checkpoint instead
  of carrying every short historical instruction that fits its character
  budget; a message that does not fit is never replayed as an unmarked fragment.
  Responses `reasoning` output is now treated only as a draft: KCR2 parses the
  final `message` instead of concatenating both channels and mistaking their
  separate JSON objects for an ambiguous answer. Existing `kcr1` payloads and
  old v1 plain-summary messages still replay but are labeled
  `UNVERIFIED_LEGACY_SUMMARY`. Checkpoint excerpts reuse the managed
  caller-URL redactor and remove recognized GitHub token prefixes before they
  reach either the source catalog or serialized checkpoint. Native OpenAI
  requests still forward their encrypted compaction bytes unchanged.

- **Grok 4.6 can select Codex's native image viewer.** xAI stopped without a
  function call when the tool was named `view_image`, even when selection was
  required. The Grok OAuth boundary now presents that tool as `inspect_image`
  and restores returned calls to `view_image`, without colliding with a real
  client tool of the same alias name. This complements the existing
  image-result transport fix: Grok can now both invoke the viewer and receive
  its returned pixels.

- **Grok OAuth keeps image-bearing tool results multimodal.** The
  Chat Completions-to-Responses hop JSON-stringified every non-string tool
  result, so Codex could complete `view_image` while Grok received JSON and
  base64 text instead of pixels. Structured image output now remains
  `input_image`, preserves detail and mixed-part order, and recovers common
  image MIME types from generic octet-stream data URLs. Text-only and other
  structured tool results keep their previous behavior.

- **A Codex Stop hook continues grok-oauth mid-task stops once.** After a
  tool result, a short status sentence with no follow-up tool call used to
  hand control back. `hooks/codex-stop-grok-oauth.mjs` is a user-level Stop
  hook: it blocks only when `model` is a `grok-oauth/*` slug, the transcript
  shows a tool result then a short status, and `stop_hook_active` is false.
  Native GPT slugs fall through with `{ continue: true }`. Cap is one
  automatic continue. `CODEX_GROK_OAUTH_STOP_HOOK=0` disables it.

- **The routed-model skill says a text-only turn ends the task.** Custom
  models often emit a status sentence after a tool result and call nothing;
  Codex then hands control back. The `codex-router` skill now states that
  contract and tells the model to call the next tool in the same turn when
  work remains. This is instruction, not a protocol fix — the Grok OAuth
  after-tool retry still covers a model that ignores it.

- **Grok OAuth no longer accepts uncertified prose after a tool result as a
  successful completion.** The
  progress-only retry used to classify only on visible-text length and
  output tokens. After a successful tool, a cheap status sentence ("The
  figures are ready.", 95 tokens) never retried, and a reasoning-heavy
  one-liner was nudged with "if you are already done, stop" — so the model
  restated the status and the turn looked finished. The last non-system
  message being a tool result is now the signal, independent of language,
  phrasing, or answer length: a no-tool turn is held and retried once. The
  repair must call exactly one function: either a client tool or the router's
  private final-answer tool. The private tool is converted back to ordinary
  assistant text and never reaches Codex.
  An empty, progress-only, or failed repair becomes an explicit 502 instead
  of a clean `stop`, so Codex cannot record it as a silent success. A
  one-line verdict after a user message still gets the no-tool branch
  first, so a finished Q&A cannot be talked into a call the client would
  run.

- **Grok progress-repair usage separates context from billed spend.** Codex
  now receives the selected repair attempt's prompt count instead of the sum
  of both attempts, preventing a roughly 150k context from appearing as 300k.
  The aggregate provider cost is retained separately as billed input/output
  tokens in the local usage ledger.

- **Grok and DeepSeek advertise Codex reasoning summaries.** The catalog now
  opts the official Grok and DeepSeek thinking models into
  `supports_reasoning_summaries`, so Codex can show their thinking while a
  turn is in flight and collapse it afterwards — the same surface native GPT
  uses. Grok OAuth was dropping xAI's `reasoning_summary_text` /
  `reasoning_text` deltas on the Chat Completions hop; those now land as
  `reasoning_content` so LiteLLM can put them back on the Responses reasoning
  channel. DeepSeek already emitted `reasoning_content`; it only needed the
  catalog flag. `deepseek-chat` stays off because it is the non-thinking
  alias.

- **Grok OAuth retries a progress-only stop once on the user-message path,
  without holding the first byte.** Attempt 1 streams live. If the client offered tools and the turn
  ends with short visible text, no tool calls, and enough output tokens to be
  reasoning-heavy, the forwarder retries once with a trailing user nudge and
  *appends* only the retry's tool-call deltas plus `finish_reason:
  "tool_calls"` onto the same open stream. The first answer is kept when the
  retry also has no tools. This paragraph describes turns following a user
  message; post-tool turns use the stricter certified repair above. Both
  attempts on this older path are summed into `usage` with
  `progress_only_retried: true`; that marker is what `acceptedInputTokens`
  excludes, not a bare transport `retries` count. The retry log is not gated
  on `MODEL_ROUTER_QUIET`. Set `CODEX_ROUTER_GROK_PROGRESS_ONLY_RETRY=0` to
  pay once and see the raw first attempt. `dispatchSseBlock` now catches only
  `JSON.parse`.

  The trigger is a shape and cannot be anything else: a finished task answered
  in one line — "Yes, that is correct." after 1,500 reasoning tokens — is
  indistinguishable from a turn that stopped early, so it is retried too. The
  nudge therefore offers the no-tool branch first ("if that already completed
  the task, restate the final answer and call no tool"), which routes the
  finished case into keep-first. An imperative nudge makes such a turn invent
  a tool call, and the forwarder would graft it onto the answer for the client
  to run. A false positive now costs one round trip, not a wrong action.

- **The Devin CLI probe no longer reports "unknown" for a Devin CLI that is
  installed and working.** `devinCliVersion` was the one call site out of
  twenty that took `command` and `args` from `spawnableCommand` and threw away
  the third field. For a Windows `.cmd` shim — which is what npm installs —
  that field carries `windowsVerbatimArguments`, and without it Node re-quotes
  a command line that has already been escaped for cmd.exe. The version came
  back empty and the probe printed `unknown`, which reads as "you do not have
  the CLI" to the one person running a probe written specifically to stop that
  misdiagnosis. The probe's own convention — every outside edge injectable — now
  covers this edge too, so the options, the cmd.exe hop, and the POSIX
  pass-through are all asserted on every platform rather than only on Windows.

- **The Windows command-line escaping is now pinned against the hazards that
  could not previously be caught off Windows.** `spawnableCommand` builds one
  cmd.exe command line, and until now the only proof it was armed correctly was
  an end-to-end test that runs a real shim and therefore skips everywhere else.
  A pipe, a redirect, a `!`, and a trailing backslash before a closing quote —
  the four that would end the quoted span or start a second command if the
  escaping were wrong — are now asserted in rendered form on every platform,
  and added to the set the Windows job runs for real. No behaviour changed: the
  escaping already matched `cross-spawn` character for character.

- **Running the test suite no longer resets your subagents.**
  `test/state-owner.test.mjs` ran the real `src/catalog.mjs` against a scratch
  state directory while inheriting the developer's own `CODEX_HOME`. No
  state-directory override redirects `$CODEX_HOME/agents`, so the catalog read
  an empty state — no proofs, no selection, no picker — and pruned the real
  agents directory to the handful of models the shipped registry promotes on
  its own, deleting the definition of every model this machine had promoted
  through a local capability probe. The settings naming those models live in
  the state directory and survived, so `subagents status` kept reporting them
  as enabled while Codex had nothing left to spawn: subagents that appeared to
  reset themselves after an unrelated command. The test now isolates the home
  with the state, and a guard in the same file fails if any test spawns the
  catalog without doing so. If your routed agents are already missing, one
  catalog refresh from the owning checkout restores them.
- **A forwarder that cannot bind its port now says so.** The four forwarders
  the service starts — `kimi-oauth`, `api-forwarder`, `grok-oauth`, and
  `devin-cli` — called `listen` with no `'error'` handler, so a port already in
  use killed the process with Node's unhandled-`'error'` crash dump: `throw er`
  and a libuv stack, in a log the four of them share, naming neither the
  forwarder nor the port. Startup then reported only that *some* forwarder had
  exited before becoming healthy. Each one now reports the bind failure the way
  the router already did since #171 — one line naming itself, the address, and
  the reason — and exits with the router's own listen-failure codes (98 for
  `EADDRINUSE`, 97 for `EACCES`, 96 otherwise), so one line in the service log
  classifies the death for a supervisor and a human alike.

- **GPT-5.6 Sol can now run at the 1M context window OpenAI documents for it.**
  The catalog Codex ships declares 272,000 tokens against a documented
  1,050,000, and that figure has already moved twice
  (openai/codex#31860, #32806). Editing `model_context_window` and
  `model_auto_compact_token_limit` in `config.toml` answers this for a whole
  machine; the picker now answers it per task. **GPT-5.6-Sol (1M context)**
  (`gpt-5.6-sol-1m`) is the same upstream model published under a second slug
  with a 1,000,000-token window and compaction starting at 900,000 —
  instructions, reasoning ladder, image input, and subagent behavior are copied
  from `gpt-5.6-sol`, and the router rewrites the slug back to its base before
  the turn leaves, so OpenAI only ever sees the model it published. It ships
  **switched off**, because a turn resends the whole conversation and a request
  above 272,000 input tokens is billed at a higher rate in full: a model that
  costs more than the one it shadows has to be chosen, not discovered after the
  bill. Switch it on under OpenAI in the Settings model list, or with
  `./bin/control picker set gpt-5.6-sol-1m show`. That answer is remembered —
  later catalog rebuilds never re-apply the default to a model already decided,
  in either direction — and a login-free install does not get the entry at all,
  because its native slugs come from a server-supplied allowlist.

- **Gemini CLI is a target.** It speaks only the Gemini API and Google ships no
  bring-your-own-provider setting, so pointing it at this router used to be
  impossible — the endpoint it wants does not exist anywhere in the codebase.
  It does, however, read its endpoint, its credential, and its default model
  from the environment, and `createContentGenerator` builds a plain
  `@google/genai` client from them. So the router now serves
  `/_codex-router/<key>/gemini/v1beta/models/{model}:{method}` and writes one
  marker block into `~/.gemini/.env`. `./install.sh --target gemini` or
  `./bin/model-router gemini enable` sets it up; the next `gemini` run has the
  routed models, with nothing to restart.
  The surface reaches no provider of its own. It translates the turn into a
  Responses request and sends it through the router's existing `/v1/responses`
  over the loopback, so tool-result ageing, the vision bridge, prompt-token
  substitution, upstream retry, model failover, and usage accounting all still
  sit on one request path rather than two that would drift. Tools, system
  instructions, inline images, streaming deltas, reasoning summaries, tool calls
  and their results, usage counts, and finish reasons all cross in both
  directions. A stream the upstream drops still ends with a finish reason,
  because the SDK waits for one before it considers a turn over.
  `settings.json` is never opened for writing: it is JSONC carrying the user's
  own comments, and this integration does not need it. The `.env` block is the
  only thing written, it is 0600 because it holds the caller key, publishing
  twice is byte-identical, and removing it restores the file exactly. A managed
  key assigned outside the block stops the publish with the line named rather
  than being silently overwritten — `dotenv` lets the last assignment win, so a
  duplicate would quietly decide which endpoint is in force and nothing in the
  file would say so.
  The default model is written, unlike the harness integration's opt-in
  equivalent, because Gemini CLI's own default is a Gemini model this router
  does not route: an install that left it alone would 404 on the first turn.
  `--model` still outranks it and `--no-default-model` omits it.
  Embeddings are refused with a named 501 rather than faked, and `countTokens`
  is estimated rather than answered by spending a real turn upstream.
  None of this is documented by Google. The contract was read out of the
  installed `@google/genai` and `@google/gemini-cli-core` bundles and then
  proved by driving the real `gemini -p` at a real provider: a routed turn came
  back through the CLI verbatim, and a tool-calling turn completed the whole
  loop — ten tool schemas out, a tool call in, its result back out, and the
  model's answer in. That live run is what caught the one bug the unit tests
  could not: a Gemini tool declares its schema as `parametersJsonSchema`, not
  `parameters`, so the first cut sent every tool upstream with no schema at all
  and the CLI rejected each call the model made with "params must have required
  property 'file_path'".
- The rule for which models may be published to a client that carries no ChatGPT
  session of its own now lives in `src/routed-client-models.mjs` instead of
  inside the harness manager. It was always a general rule; a second client
  wanting it verbatim is what made a second copy the wrong answer.
- **A subagent that had been proven once could never be un-proven, however
  badly it behaved afterwards.** The observer that settles a locally verified
  subagent gated itself on `awaitingSpawnProof`, which is true only while a
  slug sits in the experimental window — so the instant turn one promoted a
  model, the router stopped watching it. A hard 400/422 on turn two was
  discarded with everything else, and the only thing that could re-examine the
  slug was a hand-run `control subagents verify` (#257). Two changes, both
  about the gate rather than the thresholds. `proven` is now revocable: the
  same structural rejection that would have blocked promotion takes it back
  afterwards, without needing to repeat, because nothing makes a 400 weaker
  after a 200 than before it and the transient statuses that prove nothing
  (429, 5xx, disconnects) were already excluded. Registry-v2 models are
  untouched — their claim is the shipped native collaboration proof, not one
  machine's traffic — and re-promotion stays manual, since that is the
  direction that spends quota. And a child that answers turn after turn
  without converging is now demotable at all: it emits nothing but 200s, so no
  status-shaped branch could ever see it, and the evidence instead is how much
  of its own budget one spawn burns while still going. `src/subagent-turns.mjs`
  accounts each spawn separately by `thread-id` and adds up the new input
  tokens it produces — every child turn resends the whole conversation, so
  growth in the prompt count is what the child newly made, and a compaction
  makes the count fall so everything after it is work being done twice. The
  ceiling is twice the larger of the model's declared `autoCompact` budget and
  the largest prompt the spawn has actually had accepted: one budget is a large
  but legitimate task, and it is compacting *again* without ever finishing that
  names the runaway, which is the same pathology
  `context-window-drift.mjs` and #266 already describe. No round number was
  invented — `autoCompact` is per model and comes from the provider's own
  published window, and a model that declares none is counted but never
  condemned. Measuring against the spawn's own observed peak as well as the
  declaration makes a false demotion impossible rather than merely unlikely: an
  uncompacted spawn's total is exactly half its own ceiling however long its
  task runs, so neither a model whose declared budget sits far below its window
  nor a single oversized tool result can condemn anything. Only prompt counts
  the provider actually reported move the total,
  so substituted estimates and retry-doubled counts cannot manufacture a
  demotion. Both paths log unconditionally and record the turn and token
  counts in the proofs file, so `control subagents status` and the tray say
  what happened rather than a picker entry quietly disappearing.
- **A passing Devin CLI probe now means something.** The provider's Cascade
  transport was transcribed from a shipped binary and has never met Cognition's
  backend, so #270 asks a volunteer with an account to settle it. The probe that
  ask points at printed one line per stage, and every one of those lines could
  pass while the thing it was meant to prove had failed: an empty model list
  read as `OK: account advertises 0 model(s)`, a stream that decoded to nothing
  read as `OK: streamed 0 character(s)`, and a tool call that arrived under a
  field number this build does not know was skipped in silence and reported as a
  model that chose not to call a tool — the one failure that decides whether
  Codex can drive the provider at all. The probe now audits the raw bytes
  alongside the schema and prints a PASS/FAIL line per assumption with the
  observed value on each failure, so a run that reports success has confirmed
  each one separately: request encoding, model list decoding, envelope framing,
  the compression flag, the end-of-stream terminator, stop reason, usage,
  tool-call ids and arguments, and a replay of the captured bytes through the
  client a routed turn actually runs. Where a tool call goes missing, three
  distinct lines separate a renumbered field from a model that declined. The
  live turn is now capped at 64 output tokens and 90 seconds, `--live` remains
  the only flag that spends anything, a mistyped flag fails the run instead of
  quietly downgrading it, and the output folds `$HOME` to `~` and carries no
  token, because it is written to be pasted into a public issue.
  `docs/DEVIN-CLI-PROBE.md` is the tester's copy of all of it.

- **The Devin CLI transport now reports a refusal as a refusal.** Its Connect
  client carried ten of the protocol's sixteen error codes, and the six it did
  not — `canceled`, `already_exists`, `aborted`, `out_of_range`, `data_loss`,
  and `unimplemented` — fell through to 502. Every layer above reads a 5xx as a
  bad moment in the chain rather than an answer: the vision bridge retries it,
  and Codex spends its own reconnects on it. `unimplemented` is what Cascade
  answers when the service path or method name has drifted from the binary these
  schemas were transcribed from, so the one code that can never succeed was the
  one dressed as worth another try. The client now imports the full table from
  `src/connect-stream-audit.mjs` instead of restating half of it, so
  `unimplemented` arrives as 501, `already_exists` and `aborted` as 409,
  `out_of_range` as 400, and `canceled` as 499 — none of them retryable — on
  both the HTTP failure path and the end-of-stream terminator.
- **A compressed Connect frame is no longer a silently empty answer.** Each
  Connect envelope has a flags byte whose low bit marks the message compressed,
  and the client ignored it: the frame went to the protobuf decoder, which is
  not being handed protobuf, and the turn ended with no text and no tool calls
  or with a wire-type error naming nothing anyone could act on. The client now
  asks for `connect-accept-encoding: identity` on both call shapes and, if a
  frame arrives compressed regardless, fails with a named
  `devin_compressed_frame` (501) instead of guessing — including on the
  end-of-stream terminator, where a compressed frame would otherwise have read
  as the empty `{}` that means the turn succeeded. Decompression is deliberately
  not implemented: no maintainer can reach Cascade to test it, and a compliant
  server has no reason to compress once it has been told identity.

- **Grok OAuth no longer loses late or custom tool calls.** The forwarder now
  accepts `function_call` and `custom_tool_call` items that first appear in
  `response.output_item.done`, restores final arguments when argument deltas
  are absent, joins repeated SSE `data:` fields, and consumes the final event
  even when the upstream omits its trailing blank line. Streaming remains live
  while the upstream turn is running.

- **Curated models were filed at 131072 tokens however big they actually
  were, and the million-token ones compacted on every turn.** Curation stored
  one conservative window for every model it added, so a model OpenRouter
  advertises at 1,050,000 was told to auto-compact at 110,000 — eight times
  below its real capacity. That is not a cosmetic understatement: when a
  provider answers with `prompt_tokens: 0` the router substitutes an estimate
  of the prompt it just sent, and that estimate errs high on purpose, so
  against a threshold this low it landed above the compaction limit turn after
  turn. The session summarized itself, lost its working state, redid the same
  opening work, and summarized again without ever finishing (#266). The
  provider's catalog already carries the answer, so discovery now reads it:
  `context_length`, the figure the serving endpoint reports under
  `top_provider`, `context_window`, or Copilot's
  `capabilities.limits.max_context_window_tokens`, taking the smallest of the
  ones present because those are limits at different scopes and only the
  narrowest is the one the request path can rely on. Both curation forms store
  it, and `autoCompact` follows from it; the interactive prompt offers it as
  the default rather than making the user retype a number the provider already
  published. A model the catalog sizes in silence still falls back to 131072,
  and an entry curated earlier keeps what it was given — an additive run never
  rewrites metadata a user may have tuned by hand, so repair it in
  `user-models.json` or `--remove` and curate it again.

- **The substituted prompt-token estimate charged the session for reasoning no
  model ever reads.** When a provider answers with `prompt_tokens: 0` the
  router substitutes an estimate of the prompt it just sent, dividing the
  serialized request body by 3.3 bytes per token. That divisor is calibrated
  against text a model reads, and the body is not: most of a Codex turn is
  `encrypted_content`, the sealed chain of thought carried on every reasoning
  item. The gateway's Responses-to-chat bridge drops reasoning items outright
  and no routed provider can decrypt another vendor's token, so those bytes buy
  zero prompt tokens — but they were counted, and there can be a lot of them.
  The router already sheds some: a reasoning item that carries summary text and
  sits immediately before the turn it belongs to is rewritten into assistant
  text, ciphertext and all. An item with an empty summary, which is what a
  provider returns when it has none to give, is forwarded whole. Measured
  through the router itself on a twelve-turn tool loop: with summaries no
  ciphertext reaches the gateway at all, and without them every blob does and
  they are 64% of the body the router sends. Charging that 64% at 3.3 bytes per
  token is where the field reports of 3.9x–4.7x come from, and an estimate that
  high clears `autoCompact` on a window the session is nowhere near, so it
  compacted on every turn the provider reported as zero (#266). The
  estimate now discounts `encrypted_content` and counts everything else. The
  subtraction is deliberately one-sided: an unrecognized field is still counted,
  so a body shape nobody anticipated errs high rather than estimating near zero,
  and JSON escaping, structural scaffolding, and base64 image data all stay on
  the bill for the same reason. The clamp to the declared context window is
  unchanged, but it now means something. It used to fire on conversations at a
  quarter of the limit, and since `autoCompact` is 85% of the window a clamped
  estimate compacts by construction. Counting only model-visible bytes puts a
  floor under it: the estimate can only reach the window if the visible text
  does, so a clamped estimate now means the conversation really is between 82.5%
  and 100% of the limit, where compacting is the right answer.
- **A subagent on a thinking model poisoned the conversation that spawned it.**
  Every request after the child finished came back as a 400 reading "The
  `reasoning_content` in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API",
  seen on DeepSeek V4 Flash through the opencode Go subscription. LiteLLM's
  Responses-to-chat translation drops `reasoning` input items outright, and the
  carry that compensates for that only recognised a tool loop — reasoning
  sitting immediately before a `function_call`. A subagent ends in prose, so
  the reasoning behind its final answer was thrown away and the provider was
  asked to continue a thinking turn it had never been shown. The carry now
  covers every assistant turn: prose answers and custom tool calls as well as
  function calls, and the whole run of reasoning items a turn emits rather than
  only the last of them. It merges into the assistant message instead of
  inserting a second one, because two assistant turns back to back are their
  own rejection on the same providers. "Compact old tool results" was reported
  alongside this and is not involved — the aging pass only ever rewrites the
  `output` of a tool result, and now has a test proving the reasoning and
  assistant turns around it come through by reference. A subagent is not
  required to reach this: an ordinary follow-up after any thinking-mode answer
  fails the same way on a build that predates the fix, and that plainest path
  is pinned by its own test.
- **A single bad upstream response could take the whole router down.** LiteLLM
  1.96.0 raises out of its own request handler while mapping an upstream 429 —
  opencode Zen's exhausted free tier is one reliable way to reach it — and the
  gateway process ends with exit code 1. The service raced every child's exit,
  so that one failed request also killed the router and all three forwarders,
  and from then on every client got a bare `Connection error` naming nothing
  (#261). The gateway is now supervised: it is restarted in place, with a
  doubling backoff and at most five restarts inside ten minutes, while the
  router keeps listening — so a crash costs one stalled request instead of the
  session, and the next one is answered by a live gateway. Every crash, every
  restart, and the decision to stop restarting are logged unconditionally, and
  when the bound is exhausted the service exits exactly as before so the OS
  supervisor performs a clean restart. Supervision starts only once the gateway
  has been healthy: a gateway that never came up is still a startup failure, not
  a retry loop. `/health` now names which local service is unreachable, so
  doctor reports "serving but reports gateway unreachable" instead of "not
  ready", and `CODEX_ROUTER_GATEWAY_RESTARTS=0` restores the old behaviour for
  an investigation that wants the process to die where it died. The pinned
  litellm version is unchanged: a router that survives its gateway is worth
  having whichever version is installed.

  Startup also stopped refusing a Windows batch launcher. Node has declined to
  spawn a `.cmd`/`.bat` without a shell since CVE-2024-27980, so pointing
  `MODEL_ROUTER_LITELLM_BIN` at a batch wrapper ended the service before it
  spawned anything, with an `EINVAL` naming neither the file nor the reason.
  The launcher now goes through the same `spawnableCommand` helper every other
  external command in the repository uses. The shipped installer produces
  `litellm.exe`, so a normal Windows install is unaffected.
- **Command Code was unusable on every plan but one, which is not the plan most
  of its customers buy.** The provider only ever spoke `/provider/v1`, and that
  surface is an entitlement rather than a credential: a $1 Go account signs in,
  mints a real key, runs the official CLI all day, and is still answered `403
  upgrade_required` — "Your Go plan doesn't include API access". The router's
  only response was a plan note explaining why nothing worked. The `command-code`
  CLI itself does not use that surface; every turn it takes goes to
  `/alpha/generate`, which is not plan-gated. The forwarder now answers the
  entitlement refusal by moving the turn there, so Go, GOAT, Pro, and Max are
  served with the same key, the same catalog, and no upgrade. Both protocols are
  covered: the chat-completions catalog and the Messages variant that carries the
  Claude models. The refusal is remembered against a fingerprint of the
  credential — never the key — so it is bought once rather than once per turn,
  re-probed when the key changes, and re-checked every six hours in case the plan
  did. Only a real `upgrade_required` may move a turn; a timeout, a 500, or any
  other 403 is relayed with the provider's own message, because reading one of
  those as a refusal would quietly move a paying Provider-plan account onto its
  coding-plan credits. The fallback happens before the first relayed byte, the
  same boundary the upstream-retry and model-failover rules draw.

  That route carries the CLI's own envelope, not an OpenAI or Anthropic body, so
  both directions are translated: a schema-strict `config` block where every
  field is required and `memory` is a string rather than an object, messages in
  the Vercel AI SDK `ModelMessage` schema, snake_case `input_schema` tools, and a
  newline-delimited JSON response — despite its `text/event-stream` content type
  — whose blocks interleave and whose trailing `tool-call` event keys on
  `toolCallId` where every incremental event keys on `id`. Command Code publishes
  no reference for any of it; the shapes were derived from the shipped CLI bundle
  (v1.14.1) and confirmed against the live gateway.

  One measurement changed the design. An empty `system` field is not "no system
  prompt" to that route — it is a cue to splice in the Command Code agent's own
  preamble. The same one-line turn cost 92 prompt tokens with a system prompt and
  7,637 without, spent telling the model it was a different product with
  different tools. A turn carrying no system prompt of its own now gets a neutral
  one instead of the agent's.

- **The tray showed Command Code's spending windows but not what was left to
  spend.** The billing route it already polls reports the credit pool beside the
  5-hour and weekly caps, and a coding plan runs out of the first long before it
  stops hitting the second. Plan, purchased, and free credits now surface as a
  balance metric, and the plan's own low-credit threshold marks it unavailable.
- **Retained tool results had no way to be seen and no way to be cleared.**
  Tool-result compaction parks the exact original bytes of a result it rewrote
  in `<state dir>/retained-tool-results`. That store is bounded and fails safe —
  at its cap it stops accepting new results and eligible results pass through
  uncompacted — but it has no eviction and no TTL, so the only way to empty it
  was `rm -rf`, and the first time most operators would learn it existed was
  while hunting disk usage. It also matters more than its byte count: tool
  results carry file contents, command output, and API responses, and this is
  the one place the router keeps model-visible *content* on disk rather than the
  counts and bytes its telemetry is limited to.

  `./bin/doctor` now reports the store on every run — file count, total size,
  and the age of the oldest entry — and reports it whether or not the directory
  exists, because "nothing retained" is the answer most installs should see and
  seeing it is what makes the directory discoverable at all. A store parked at
  its cap is reported as a warning rather than as healthy, since that state is
  permanent until somebody empties it.

  `./bin/control tool-result-aging purge` empties it. It is a report by default:
  without `--yes` it prints what it would remove and removes nothing, and
  `--dry-run` says the same thing explicitly and outranks `--yes` so a wrapper
  that always consents can still preview. Deletion is confined to the store by
  construction rather than by intent — only names retention itself produces,
  only entries whose parent resolves to that one directory, no recursion, and no
  symlink is followed or removed. Anything else that ends up in there is left in
  place and named. The directory itself is kept: emptying it is the whole job,
  and removing it under a concurrent write buys nothing.

- **Devin's models are reachable from the session its CLI already stored, and
  this adds the provider that reaches them — untested against a real account.**
  `devin auth login` writes a persistent token to `credentials.toml`, so
  `devin-cli` reuses it exactly as `kimi-oauth` and `grok-oauth` reuse theirs.
  The transport is the part with no precedent here: Cognition publishes a
  session API, not a chat API, and the models answer only on Cascade —
  `exa.api_server_pb.ApiServerService` over Connect RPC — so this ships a small
  protobuf wire codec, the message subset transcribed from the descriptor set
  embedded in the shipped `devin` binary, a Connect streaming client, and a
  forwarder translating OpenAI Chat Completions into a `GetChatMessage` turn
  and its deltas back. Reasoning and tool calls are mapped; images ride only on
  the current turn, because replaying an older one fails the whole request.
  Thirty-seven tests cover the codec against hand-computed bytes, the request
  mapping, the credential reader, and envelope framing including a split frame
  and an error carried in the end-of-stream terminator. None of that proves
  Cascade accepts the request: no maintainer holds a Devin account, so the
  provider ships catalog-only with no checked-in models and is documented as
  unverified. `bin/devin-probe` is the way to find out — it checks the
  credential and lists the account's models for free, and `--live --tools`
  spends one turn to prove a streamed answer and a forced tool call.

  Nobody who has not asked for Devin pays anything for it being here. The
  forwarder is spawned only when the registry actually holds a `devin-cli`
  model, so an install that never ran `bin/curate-models devin-cli` starts no
  fourth child, binds no fourth port, and waits on no fourth health probe —
  startup is byte-for-byte the work it was before. The gate is the curated
  model rather than the stored credential on purpose: a curated model is
  precisely what puts a `DEVIN_CLI_FORWARD_BASE_URL` route in the generated
  gateway config, and the route and the listener are decided from the same
  model list on the same boot, so a live route can never point at a port
  nothing is listening on. Gating on `credentials.toml` would have been the
  wrong trade — someone who curated a model but has not run `devin auth login`
  gets a 401 naming that command, which a missing forwarder would have turned
  into a bare connection error. When Devin *is* routed, everything is as
  before: the forwarder is health-waited alongside the other three, an
  unbindable port still aborts startup naming the forwarder, and a forwarder
  that dies still ends the service so the OS supervisor rebuilds it.
- **A retained tool result kept forever was an archive nobody chose.** The store
  had a cap but no lifetime, so bytes retained today were still on disk a year
  from now, and a store that reached 512 files or 512 MiB stopped retaining
  anything new permanently — until somebody noticed and emptied it by hand.
  Retained originals now expire after **7 days**.

  The number is derived rather than round. Nothing ever reads those bytes back
  into a turn: the receipt tells the model to repeat the tool call, so a
  retained original's only reader is the operator, forensically, and only while
  the session that produced it still matters. The caps say the same thing about
  intent — 512 files and 512 MiB against a 32 KiB compaction floor is a working
  set of a few long sessions, not a history. And a week is already this
  repository's horizon for "recent enough to still act on", in the catalog's
  announce window and the vision host's size cache alike.

  Nothing sweeps on a timer and nothing is added to startup. Entries expire when
  the store is next written to — the way the cooldown store is trimmed on its
  next write, and the way a provider cooldown reads as gone long before anything
  deletes it. `./bin/doctor` therefore reports what has already aged out rather
  than what has been removed, and `./bin/control tool-result-aging purge
  --expired` runs that sweep by hand for an install where compaction is off and
  nothing is going to write again. It carries the same `--yes` consent, the same
  `--dry-run`, and the same containment as a full purge, and it never removes
  the key that binds the store's names to the install — expiring that would
  orphan the entries the TTL just decided to keep.

  `./bin/control tool-result-aging ttl <days|off|default>` sets the lifetime.
  `off` is a real answer, kept verbatim: an operator who wants the archive keeps
  it, and no later default overwrites that. A state file written before the TTL
  existed never answered the question, so it reads as the default rather than as
  "keep them forever". The `CODEX_ROUTER_TOOL_RESULT_AGING=0` kill switch does
  not disable expiry — it stops the router rewriting request context, and expiry
  is disk hygiene for bytes that are already written.

- **Every turn against a Meta model failed on the web search tool.** Meta's
  Responses surface answered each one with a 400 reading
  "`tools[].search_content_types` is only supported for web_search_preview
  tools", so Muse Spark 1.1, 1.2, and 1.2 Contributor were unusable rather than
  degraded — the tool is declared on the turn whenever web search is enabled,
  so this had nothing to do with whether the model actually searched. Codex
  sends the current spelling of
  that tool (`type: "web_search"`, carrying `search_content_types` beside
  `external_web_access`, `filters`, and `user_location`); Meta validates it
  against the legacy `web_search_preview` schema, which is the one place it
  accepts the field. The forwarder now drops `search_content_types` from a Meta
  request, and nothing else: the search tool itself still reaches the model with
  the rest of its settings, and a caller that sends Meta a real
  `web_search_preview` tool keeps the field on it. Scoped to Meta on purpose —
  OpenAI documents `search_content_types` on `web_search` and not on
  `web_search_preview`, the reverse of what this endpoint enforces, so the other
  Responses-native providers keep a parameter the current spec grants them.
  (#286)

- **The free Qwen3.8 endpoint refused any conversation whose system message
  arrived late or twice.** Its chat template answers those with a 400 reading
  "System message must be at the beginning", and a real Codex session reaches
  that shape routinely — a second system message, or one appended after the
  conversation is already under way. Probing the live endpoint pinned the rule
  to at most one `system` message sitting ahead of the first user, assistant, or
  tool turn; the `developer` role is outside it entirely, so
  `[developer, system, user]` is accepted and "the beginning" means before the
  first turn rather than index 0. The request profile now coalesces the system
  messages into one and places it ahead of the first turn, handling both plain
  string content and content-parts arrays, and leaves developer messages exactly
  where they are. A conversation the rule already allows is forwarded unchanged.
  Hoisting is a compatibility repair with a real cost — instructions the caller
  placed mid-conversation are read as opening context instead — accepted only
  because the alternative from this endpoint is no answer at all.

- **Every compaction against the free Qwen3.8 endpoint failed on an empty tool
  list.** Compaction disables tool use by sending `tools: []`, which every other
  forwarder reads as "no tools" — this endpoint's vLLM build answers it with a
  400 saying the array must not be empty and the field should be omitted
  instead, and answers the tool choice sent alongside it with a second 400
  saying `tools` must be set. The model carries a 262K window that auto-compacts
  at 230K, so the failure was not an edge case: it was every long session. The
  request profile now omits an empty list and then drops the tool choice that
  strip leaves with nothing to choose from. The repair sits at the last hop
  before this one endpoint, because an empty tool list stays the correct way to
  disable tools everywhere else, and a real tool list still forwards untouched.

  The entry is also renamed to **Qwen3.8-27-free-victor**, crediting `victor`,
  who publishes the endpoint, in the name the picker shows rather than only in
  the endpoint note.
- **A turn whose provider has run out of usage now continues on another model.**
  An install with thirty providers configured runs out of one of them most days:
  a coding-plan window closes, a weekly quota lands, a balance empties. The
  router named that failure clearly and then stopped — Codex has nothing to do
  with a billing error, so a session mid-task simply ended, subagents included,
  while every other model the operator could reach sat unused. The turn is now
  rebuilt for the next eligible model and sent again, and the client sees one
  clean answer.

  What qualifies is deliberately narrow: an exhausted balance or plan limit, a
  402, or a 429 whose `Retry-After` is longer than a minute. A rejected
  credential, an unknown model, a malformed request, and every 5xx keep exactly
  the error they returned before — swapping models to dodge a bad key would hide
  the one fact that fixes it, and a short rate limit is cheaper to wait out than
  a cold prompt cache is to pay for. Free models are tried before paid ones,
  then the rest in the registry's own preference order; a model on your own
  machine is never chosen automatically, because the runtime might not be
  running. A candidate whose context window cannot hold the conversation is
  skipped, so a quota failure is never traded for a context-window rejection.

  When a provider says when it will be back, that window is believed: the next
  turn skips it outright instead of buying the same rejection again, and it is
  used again by itself once the window passes or the next time it answers. A
  reset time is never invented, only ever read from the provider, and it is
  capped at six hours so a malformed one cannot strand a model.

  Nothing about the swap is silent, and nothing is injected into the transcript.
  The router logs it (never gated on `CODEX_ROUTER_QUIET`), the tray Island names
  the model actually answering, and the usage event carries `failoverFrom` so a
  rescued turn stays distinguishable from one that never failed. Compaction gets
  the same treatment, because a compaction that fails ends a session just as
  hard. `./bin/control failover status|on|off|chain <slugs>|auto|reset`; the
  doctor reports any provider currently being held off and when it clears.

- **The GLM-5.3 1M entry routed to a model code Z.ai does not serve.** Shipping
  `glm-5.3[1m]` took the vendor's documented 1M suffix at its word, and the
  suffix answers `1214` on both the OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic endpoints --
  every request through that entry failed, while plain `glm-5.3` on the same
  endpoint and credential succeeded. The entry is gone rather than repaired,
  because there is nothing behind it to repair. The window it was invented to
  reach turned out to be served on the plain entry all along: a 990,020-token
  prompt was accepted, so `zai-coding/glm-5.3` declares 1M and its picker
  description says so instead of directing readers to an entry that no longer
  exists. A `config.toml` still naming the removed slug has nothing to route to
  and fails at the native target; reselect the plain GLM-5.3 entry.

- **A `custom` provider whose models each name their own endpoint.** Every other
  provider owns one address, which is why "route this one model from that one
  host" has always meant inventing a whole provider for it. `custom` owns none:
  each of its models carries its own `baseUrl`, its own auth, and its own
  metadata, so one picker entry can hold a free community endpoint, a
  self-hosted server, and a paid API with a key, at once. Enabling it asks for
  nothing and it is never in the default set, because what it holds is whatever
  somebody put in it.

  Its first model is the free community Hugging Face Inference Endpoint for
  `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: no API key, 262K context, image input, tool calling, and a
  thinking budget the effort picker dials. Every capability was measured against
  the live endpoint rather than read off its model card — including the one
  divergence, that its vLLM build validates `reasoning_effort` against a literal
  set omitting the Codex ladder's `ultra`, so the request profile folds exactly
  that rung onto `max` and leaves every other tier alone. It is shared, rate
  limited per IP, and its owner says it will be retired once launch interest
  fades: a model to try, not one to depend on.

  The security rule follows the address down rather than staying at the provider.
  A `custom` endpoint reached with no credential must have that address
  allowlisted in code, exactly as an anonymous provider's is — otherwise adding a
  JSON file under `config/custom/` would be enough to send prompts to any host on
  the internet with nothing to authenticate them. A keyless endpoint stays
  loopback-only, neither may declare an environment override that would walk
  around those two rules, and an endpoint's identity is derived from its model so
  one model's credential file can never be pointed at another model's secret.

- **The GLM-5.3 1M entry routed to a model code Z.ai does not serve.** Shipping
  `glm-5.3[1m]` took the vendor's documented 1M suffix at its word, and the
  suffix answers `1214` on both the OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic endpoints --
  every request through that entry failed, while plain `glm-5.3` on the same
  endpoint and credential succeeded. The entry is gone rather than repaired,
  because there is nothing behind it to repair. The window it was invented to
  reach turned out to be served on the plain entry all along: a 990,020-token
  prompt was accepted, so `zai-coding/glm-5.3` declares 1M and its picker
  description says so instead of directing readers to an entry that no longer
  exists. A `config.toml` still naming the removed slug has nothing to route to
  and fails at the native target; reselect the plain GLM-5.3 entry.

- **A free Qwen3.8-27B provider that needs no account.** `qwen38-free` routes
  the community Hugging Face Inference Endpoint for `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: no API
  key, 262K context, image input, tool calling, and a thinking budget the
  effort picker dials. It joins `opencode-free` and `kilo-free` as an anonymous
  provider, so it is never selected on anyone's behalf and never defaulted --
  `./bin/model-router codex providers enable qwen38-free` is the whole setup.
  Unlike those two it is not catalog-only: a single-model endpoint has no
  naming rule to filter by, so its one documented free ID lives in code beside
  the endpoint allowlist and the model ships with metadata verified against the
  live endpoint rather than guessed by `curate-models`. The endpoint validates
  `reasoning_effort` against a literal set that omits the Codex ladder's
  `ultra`, so its request profile folds exactly that rung onto `max` and leaves
  every other tier -- and forced tool choices, which it answers correctly --
  alone. It is shared, rate limited per IP, and its owner says it will be
  retired once launch interest fades: a model to try, not one to depend on.

- **The panel's local-model view surfaces LM Studio.** LM Studio arrived as a
  provider with exactly one door: `./bin/curate-models lmstudio` in an
  interactive terminal, while the panel's Local LLMs section read only
  `ollama list` -- so models loaded in LM Studio were invisible there and
  uncountable in its summary. The snapshot now carries an LM Studio section
  read from the server's own `/v1/models` endpoint, the panel lists what it
  serves with checkboxes, and checking one publishes it through the same
  user-model overlay the terminal writes, so neither door can strand the
  other's entries. A stopped server reads "not running" instead of the section
  vanishing, and a curated model the server no longer serves stays visible as
  such rather than lingering in the picker with no way to see why.

## 0.4.0-beta.4

- **A command that opens the browser panel.** The panel shipped with no way to
  reach it: its URL carries the caller capability, and nothing printed one, so
  "nothing to install" still meant "and no way in". `codex-router.ps1 panel`
  (`bin/panel`) opens it in the default browser. It reports the router being
  down instead of opening a page that would load empty, and prints the address
  redacted, because AGENTS.md treats the capability path as local
  authentication; `--print` is the deliberate exception and says what it is
  handing over.

- **Caller-key redaction covered only `/v1`.** `redactCallerUrl` is what keeps
  the capability out of support bundles, doctor output, and error messages, and
  it matched the API path alone -- so a panel URL, the identical secret in the
  identical position, travelled through every one of those surfaces verbatim.
  It now covers each leaf the capability guards.

- **The companion no longer requires a Rust toolchain.** Building it meant
  installing cargo, the heaviest prerequisite in the project, asked of someone
  who only wanted to see the panel; without it the install step failed and the
  machine ended up with no companion at all. `tray install` now falls back to
  the Electron shell, which needs only the Node the router install already
  required, and `codex-router.ps1 companion` selects it explicitly.
  `scripts/build-electron-companion.ps1` and its shell counterpart verify the
  runtime is actually present: npm 11 blocks install scripts by default and
  electron downloads its runtime from one, so `npm ci` exits 0 having fetched
  the package but not the binary, and the failure surfaces much later as an app
  that never starts.

- **Every single-argument Windows subcommand was unreachable.** PowerShell
  enumerates a statement's output into an assignment, so
  `$Arguments = if (...) { @(...) }` collapsed a one-element array to the
  element itself; `$Arguments[0]` then indexed a String and returned its first
  character. `codex-router.ps1 tray status` died on "Unknown tray action 's'",
  as did start, stop, restart, and uninstall. The existing tests asserted the
  script's text rather than running it, so none of them saw it.

- **`bin/` scripts were not pinned to LF.** They are the same POSIX shell
  scripts as `install.sh` without the extension, so `.gitattributes`' `*.sh`
  rule never reached them and a Windows checkout with `core.autocrlf=true`
  rewrote all 27 to CRLF, which `sh` fails on. The blobs were already LF, which
  is why POSIX installs kept working and the damage stayed invisible.

- **The companion opens in a browser, with nothing to install.** The router is
  already an HTTP server on loopback with a capability-gated path, and the UI
  is plain HTML whose entire backend surface is one function, so it now serves
  itself at `/panel` behind the same caller capability every other local
  endpoint uses. No binary, no toolchain, no packaging, no tray icon to find.
  The panel deliberately carries only the reading half of the command table:
  a browser tab is reachable by anything that learns the capability, and
  "save this API key" is not something to expose on that assumption.

- **An Electron shell, packaged.** `apps/electron` builds an installer through
  electron-builder (NSIS and zip on Windows, AppImage on Linux). It is a shell
  rather than a second application: `apps/desktop/ui` is loaded verbatim and
  every command runs through the same table, so all three surfaces -- tray,
  Electron, browser panel -- are windows onto one application. The command
  table moved to `src/desktop-commands.mjs` for exactly that reason.

- **The desktop companion is a download now, not a build.** It could be
  obtained exactly one way -- install a Rust toolchain and compile it -- which
  is a hard prerequisite for anyone who only wants to run it. CI was already
  building the Windows and Linux binaries on every run and discarding them, and
  releases shipped source archives only. Releases now attach
  `codex-router-tray-<version>-windows-x64.exe` and the Linux binary,
  checksummed in `SHA256SUMS` and covered by the same provenance attestation as
  every other asset; CI publishes the same binaries as artifacts so unreleased
  changes can be tried without a toolchain. Windows already ships the WebView2
  runtime the companion needs, so a downloaded binary just runs.

- **The Windows tray is managed the way the macOS one is.** Installing it was
  possible but nothing else was: `bin/model-router-tray` answered Windows with
  "use scripts/build-desktop-tray.ps1" and `codex-router.ps1` had no `tray`
  verb at all, so where macOS and Linux each have one command that builds the
  companion and hands it to a supervisor, Windows had two incantations and no
  way to check, restart, or remove it. `./codex-router.ps1 tray
  [install|status|start|stop|restart|uninstall]` is that command. Install
  rebuilds only when the sources moved and stamps the build, so an update no
  longer rebuilds a current companion from scratch — Windows was missing from
  the rebuild gating entirely, which meant the one platform whose tray must be
  built deliberately was also the one that never recorded having been built.
  Guided setup now runs the same command instead of repeating its steps.

- **`control apply` stopped carrying its own Windows installer invocation.** It
  reuses the checkout-installer helper that `update` already uses and that is
  unit tested, rather than a second hand-written PowerShell argument list that
  nothing covered — the follow-up asked for in the review of #186.
- **A credential-free install mode for lifecycle validation.** (#224)
  `install.sh --no-provider --no-discovery` (PowerShell: `-NoProvider
  -NoDiscovery`) installs the router idle: an explicit empty provider
  selection, no credential prompts, and a persisted discovery kill-switch
  honored by every credential reader — provider key files, the macOS
  Keychain, other CLIs' OAuth and session files, Codex's `auth.json`, and the
  `codex login status` probe all stay untouched. Codex traffic gets a local
  `503 router_idle_no_provider` instead of provider or native forwarding, the
  doctor reports the idle state at warn and exits 0, and a new `stop`
  subcommand completes the install → start → status → doctor → stop →
  uninstall loop. Re-running setup without the flags leaves idle mode. As
  part of this, an explicitly empty provider selection now passes
  `ensure-configured` as idle, which also un-breaks `bin/update` for anyone
  who had hidden their last provider by hand.
- **Uninstalling the last client integration now removes the background
  service.** Whether Codex still counted as installed was keyed on the cached
  native catalog, a file uninstall deliberately retains — so the service, its
  LaunchAgent, and its listening ports survived every codex uninstall. The
  installed-state witness is now the managed block in `config.toml`, which
  enable writes and disable removes; `bin/disable` of the last client retires
  the service too, matching what the Windows wrapper always did, and
  `bin/enable` reinstalls it on the way back.

- **Switching a model on as a subagent now researches it instead of ignoring
  it.** Only six registry-proven models could ever be spawned as native v2
  children; everything else the operator enabled was a silent no-show, and
  promoting one more meant a repository change per model per provider. Now the
  toggle is the assignment: enabling a model hands it to a detached capability
  probe (two live requests proving streaming and a forced tool call through
  the installed router), a passing model is advertised to Codex as an
  experimental subagent, and the first real child turn settles the verdict —
  the router watches its own request path for `x-openai-subagent` turns, and a
  clean completion records a durable machine-local proof while a structural
  rejection demotes the model back to v1 with the reason kept in the subagent
  snapshot. Evidence lives in the protected `multi-agent-proofs.json`; local
  settings still cannot manufacture a v2 claim, hidden or switched-off models
  stay v1 whatever evidence they carry, and `control subagents verify` re-runs
  the research explicitly.

- **A reasoning model no longer answers into thirty seconds of silence.** The
  empty-completion guard buffered every routed streaming response until it saw
  content, and reasoning deltas deliberately did not count as content. On a
  reasoning model the gap between the first reasoning delta and the first output
  token is seconds to minutes, so the guard held that entire gap and the caller
  saw nothing until the turn closed or the hold budget expired. Measured against
  `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-pro` with only this behaviour varying, the client's
  first byte moved from 30,638 ms to 517 ms; `deepseek-v4-flash` moved from
  29,409 ms to 536 ms. Both held runs parked at the 30-second budget, which is
  to say the budget decided when the caller saw anything, not the model.

  Throughput was never affected, which is why this read as a frozen turn rather
  than a slow one — and why no metric caught it. `responseStartMs` stops at
  the response headers and `firstTokenMs` fires on reasoning deltas, and the
  guard kept holding past both.

  The hold exists only to make the retry invisible, and the recorded meter
  prices it: across 19,043 routed turns it fired 168 retries, of which 17
  succeeded. Every reasoning turn paid up to thirty seconds of dead air for a
  silent rescue on roughly one routed turn in a thousand. So reasoning now ends
  the hold without settling the verdict — the stream is relayed and the guard
  keeps watching from behind it, and a turn that reasons and then produces
  nothing is still classified empty. A silent upstream has no prologue worth
  waiting for, so that case still holds every byte and still retries silently.

- **An empty turn that already reached the client is stated, not swallowed.**
  Once the prologue is on the wire the router cannot substitute a retry for it,
  so it writes an `error` event into the open stream instead of grafting a
  second response onto one the client is already reading. Codex treats that as
  retryable and reissues the turn on its own ladder, which recovers more than
  the single silent retry it replaces — verified against `codex-cli` 0.145.0
  with a stub upstream: a reasoning turn ending in an empty completion produced
  one request, no answer and no error, while the same turn ending in an `error`
  event produced two requests and an answer. Turns that end this way are
  metered as `emptyCompletionUnrepairable`, apart from the retried ones, because
  one is a failure the router absorbed and the other is one the user sees.

- **Finished subagents close without a click, even when the parent ignores the
  usage hint.** Codex 0.147 still maps a child's `FINAL_ANSWER` to Working for
  the live parent turn, and long San Francisco multi-agent parents often never
  call `interrupt_agent` despite the managed `root_agent_usage_hint_text`. The
  router now scans the request input for unfinished `FINAL_ANSWER` children and
  injects the missing `collaboration.interrupt_agent` calls into the parent
  response (stream and non-stream) before `response.completed`. This runs on
  both routed external models and native OpenAI multi-agent parents (the SF
  build path). Model-authored interrupts are left alone; only missing closes
  are added.

- **Finished subagents no longer stay Working just because the parent turn is
  still live.** Codex 0.147 records a child's `FINAL_ANSWER` as
  `subAgentActivity` `interacted` and maps that to Working until the parent
  turn ends, the user clicks into the child, or the parent calls
  `interrupt_agent`. `close_agent` is not in that v2 toolset. The managed
  `multi_agent_v2` block now ships a root usage hint that tells the parent to
  interrupt finished children, so new tasks settle the badge without a click.

- **GLM-5.3, on every route that actually serves it.** Z.ai shipped GLM-5.3 on
  2026-08-14. It is now in the picker three ways: `zai-coding/glm-5.3` on the
  GLM Coding Plan subscription, `zai-api/glm-5.3` on the metered platform, and
  `opencode-go/glm-5.3` on the opencode Go subscription, whose catalog already
  advertises it (`./bin/discover-models opencode-go`). Command Code, Qwen Plan,
  Ollama Cloud, and ClinePass do not carry it yet, so nothing was added there.

  Z.ai documents the 1M context window for GLM-5.3 only behind the `[1m]` model
  suffix, so that is a separate entry — `zai-coding/glm-5.3-1m`, which sends
  `glm-5.3[1m]` and a one-million-token compaction window. The suffix-free
  entries stay at the 200K lineage default rather than inheriting GLM-5.2's 1M,
  because under-declaring a context window compacts early and over-declaring
  overruns the turn.

- **A Z.ai key now means one of two different things, and the router keeps them
  apart.** `zai-api` is a new provider for the metered open platform on
  `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4`, carrying GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2 (1M context), and
  the cheaper GLM-4.7. It ships GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.2 with the same reasoning
  ladders as the plan route, and GLM-4.7 with none, because Z.ai documents no
  effort control for it.

  It is a separate credential end to end: its own key file
  (`zai-api-key.secret`), its own keychain service, and its own environment
  variable (`ZAI_PLATFORM_API_KEY`) — never the plan's `ZAI_API_KEY`. A Coding
  Plan key is not billable on the metered endpoint and vice versa, so a
  `planNote` says so wherever a key is connected, and the account panel links
  the billing page instead of polling the plan quota route with a key that has
  no plan behind it.

- **GLM reasoning effort follows the model, not the vendor.** The `glm-thinking`
  request profile mapped every multi-tier GLM onto GLM-5.2's two rungs
  (high/max), which would have silently rounded GLM-5.3's new `low` tier up to
  `high` and billed deeper thinking than was asked for. The requested effort is
  now clamped onto the ladder each model's own registry entry declares.

- **DeepSeek Harness can use the Codex models you are already signed in to.**
  Native GPT traffic is authorized by the caller's own ChatGPT session — the
  router copies `authorization` and `chatgpt-account-id` off each request, Codex
  attaches both, and a harness turn attaches neither. So the eight native models
  were withheld from the harness: advertising them would have offered a turn
  that could not authenticate.

  The router now falls back to the session this machine is already signed in
  with. You are logged in to Codex here; a client running as the same user on
  the same machine should not have to log in again. The eight `gpt-5.6-*` and
  `gpt-5.x` models publish to the harness whenever that session is usable, and
  are withheld the moment it is not, so the picker never offers a model that
  would 401.

  It is a fallback and never an override: the injection happens only for a
  request that carried no credential of its own, so a Codex turn is unchanged —
  verified by relaying a deliberately invalid token and getting that token's own
  401 back instead of a success. The credential is never logged, never returned
  by a status call, and never put in an error message.

  The session is checked for life, not just presence. That access token lasts
  about ten days and Codex renews it only when Codex is used, so a harness-only
  stretch longer than that would have left the router sending a dead token. An
  expired session is declined two minutes early, native models stop being
  published while it is dead, and `doctor` gains a line saying to open Codex
  once — which is the fix, and which nothing else would have told anybody.
  Renewal is left to Codex: reproducing that OAuth exchange would mean guessing
  an unpublished client identity and risking the very login this was asked not
  to disturb.

  Worth knowing before leaving it on: it widens what the caller key reaches,
  from the API-key providers to the ChatGPT subscription as well.
  `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_SESSION_FALLBACK=0` turns it off, and the harness drops
  back to routed models only.

- **The tray can install DeepSeek Harness, not just publish into one.**
  `--target dsh` wrote routed models into a harness the user had already
  installed themselves; on a machine without one, the missing step was an
  `npm install -g` mentioned in passing in the docs. A Settings row now installs
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh` and publishes in one click, and `control harness
  status|setup` does the same from a terminal.

  Global rather than the `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web` the harness's README
  documents: npx refetches on every run, leaves no `dsh` to type again, and is
  invisible to the presence rule that keeps the router up for clients it cannot
  watch. Node is checked against the harness's floor before npm is reached,
  since the package declares no `engines` and a stale runtime otherwise fails at
  first boot with a syntax error from inside `node_modules`. Install and publish
  are ordered but not transactional — a failed publish leaves an installed
  harness, which is where a retry wants to start, and republishing is
  byte-identical. The npm mechanics move to `src/npm-global-install.mjs`, shared
  with the provider-CLI installs rather than copied.

  It is never a side effect: no `apply`, `enable`, or repair path installs the
  harness. The model count the button reports is the routable set, not the
  picker — native GPT models come and go with the Codex session described
  above.

  The row then runs the harness's browser UI: **Install**, then **Connect**,
  then a play button, then **Open site**, each shown only in the state it
  applies to. Publishing models and leaving somebody to remember a command and a
  port was the step this action existed to remove, so the play button starts the
  UI and the row reports the URL it is serving. Setup itself deliberately does
  not start anything — it already installs a package and writes another
  program's configuration, and a republish should not put a browser window on
  screen nobody asked for.

  A running server this router did not start is adopted rather than collided
  with — the harness binds a fixed port, so a second launch exits with
  `EADDRINUSE` — and only a process this router started is ever signalled,
  matched on PID *and* process start identity because PIDs are reused.

  It can also be turned off again, which it could not safely be before.
  `bin/model-router dsh disable` ran `service.mjs uninstall` unconditionally, so
  switching the harness off removed the LaunchAgent and stopped Codex working
  too — the service is one shared plane, and one client leaving is not a reason
  to retire it. `bin/disable` now removes it only once no client integration
  remains, and the tray's **Turn off** goes through `control harness disconnect`,
  which stops a UI this router started, removes the route, and touches nothing
  else: the CLI, the harness's own settings, its other providers, and the
  service all stay.

  Two ways the uninstall could damage a user's own configuration are fixed with
  it. Restoring the default model overwrote whatever was there with the snapshot
  taken at install — so a model chosen afterwards through the harness's own
  Models page was silently discarded; the restore now applies only over a
  default this router wrote. And with no snapshot left to restore, a
  router-owned default was left in place pointing at the provider the same
  uninstall had just removed; it is now taken out.


- **A client the tray cannot watch keeps the router running.** The tray's
  presence setting could tie the router to the Codex and ChatGPT desktop apps
  and stop it 30 seconds after both closed. `NSRunningApplication` enumerates
  app bundles and nothing else, so that setting could only ever see those two:
  a `codex` TUI in a terminal and a `dsh` harness turn are both invisible to it.
  Neither can be started on demand either — a turn that finds 127.0.0.1:4202
  closed fails at once, while the stack behind that port takes up to 300 seconds
  to warm — so a terminal user who tried the setting got a dead port and a
  `doctor` line telling them to open an app they may not use.

  `effectivePresenceMode()` now reports `always` whenever the harness route is
  published or `codex` resolves on PATH, and the tray and `doctor` both act on
  that instead of the raw mode. Detection errs toward finding a client: a false
  positive costs a dormant toggle, a false negative costs somebody their next
  request. The stored preference is overridden rather than rewritten, so
  removing the client restores the user's own choice. `control --json` now
  carries a `presence` block so the router owns the rule and the tray consumes
  it rather than re-deriving it, and the tray picks up a change on the snapshot
  it already polls.

- **DeepSeek Harness is a supported target.** `--target dsh` publishes every
  routed model into the harness's own `settings.yaml` as one provider route,
  keyed to the same `/v1/responses` endpoint Codex already uses — so a harness
  turn gets the router's tool-result ageing, vision bridge, prompt-token
  substitution, bounded upstream retries, and tokens-per-second accounting
  without a second request path. The harness's shipped bundle mounts
  `dsh-llm-pi-ai` dormant and hot-reloads its settings document, so this is a
  settings write rather than a plugin change and there is nothing to restart.
  A target is a *client*, not a router: both share one service, one gateway,
  one credential store, and one provider selection, so adding the second
  integration never asks for a key again, and any change to the routable set
  republishes whichever clients are installed rather than letting the two
  drift apart.

  The router owns exactly one key in each of the harness's two documents
  (`llm-pi-ai.providers.codex-router` and `CODEX_ROUTER_CALLER_KEY`) and treats
  every other byte as somebody else's: sibling routes, other sections,
  comments, and other credentials survive a publish, and `dsh disable` restores
  the document. A settings file the new fail-closed YAML lexer cannot read
  unambiguously — a tab indent, a duplicate key, a multi-document stream, an
  inline `providers` mapping — is refused with the file untouched and the line
  named, rather than rewritten on a guess. Both documents are written 0600, the
  same bound the harness holds them to, because the settings document carries
  the managed base URL and the other carries the key it references.

  Only selected, credentialed, listed, non-hidden routed models are published.
  Native GPT models are not: they need the caller's own ChatGPT session, which
  a harness request does not carry, so advertising them would offer a turn that
  cannot authenticate — the same reason the vision-bridge engine candidates
  exclude them here. Taking over the harness's default model is opt-in,
  snapshotted, and reversible; delegation stays the user's, since
  `dsh-tool-subagent` is composition rather than settings and
  `./bin/model-router dsh subagent-preset` hands over the block to paste
  instead of editing a preset the router does not own.

- **`src/skills-install.mjs` no longer hijacks an unrelated `install`.** Its
  CLI block ran on `process.argv[2]` alone with no entry-module guard, and
  `install-manifest.mjs` imports it — so any command that transitively pulled
  the manifest in while its own subcommand happened to be `install` or
  `uninstall` installed the Codex skill pack and exited 0 before doing its own
  work. Every other module in the repository already guarded this; this one
  now does too.

- **Command Code's catalog caught up, and one dead route fixed.** The Messages
  route advertised Haiku 4.5 as `claude-haiku-4-5`, the undated alias every
  other Anthropic surface accepts. Command Code's catalog does not carry it —
  only the dated `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — so that route could never have
  resolved, and it was the one registered id in either reseller family absent
  from the live `/models` list. A registry assertion now pins the dated id.

  Fourteen models Command Code serves and the registry did not are now checked
  in: `grok-4.6`, `claude-opus-5`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`,
  `gemini-3.7-flash`, `GLM-5.2-Fast`, `Kimi-K2.7-Code-Highspeed`,
  `Qwen3.7-Flash`, and first entries for five vendors the reseller added since
  the last sweep — `meta/muse-spark-1.2`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra`,
  `sakana/fugu-ultra`, `thinkingmachines/inkling` and `inkling-small`, and
  `poolside/laguna-s-2.1`. Context windows come from Command Code's own
  `/models` payload rather than the model name; effort ladders, image support,
  and request profiles mirror the already shipped sibling of the same upstream
  line, or fall back to the conservative single-`high` floor for a vendor with
  no prior entry. Older point releases the catalog still lists behind a
  registered newer sibling (GLM-5/5.1, Kimi K2.5/K2.6, MiniMax-M2.5,
  Qwen3.6, Step-3.5, gemini-3.1/3.5-flash-lite, gpt-5.3/5.4, mimo-v2.5) stay
  out deliberately; `bin/curate-models commandcode` still reaches them per
  user.

  These fourteen route correctly — a live request reaches Command Code and
  comes back with the account's own plan verdict — but their capability
  metadata is **not** live-verified: the test account is on the Go plan, which
  answers every Provider API call with "Your Go plan doesn't include API
  access." That blocks the tool-calling, streaming, and compaction probes for
  the twenty-one models already shipped just as much as for the new ones. Run
  `./bin/test-model 'commandcode/SLUG' --live --yes` on a Provider-plan account
  before treating any of them as proven.

  opencode Go needed no additions. All seven ids its catalog lists and the
  registry omits (`glm-5`, `kimi-k2.5`, `minimax-m2.5`, `qwen3.5-plus`,
  `mimo-v2-pro`, `mimo-v2-omni`, `hy3-preview`) are older releases or preview
  channels of models already registered, and every registered opencode Go id
  is still live.

- **Windows installs the tray companion, and keeps it.** Nothing on Windows
  ever built or started it: `install.ps1` had no tray option at all, the
  installer's own decision helper excluded the platform outright, and
  `control tray enable` answered `{"supported":false}` and exited 0 — a silent
  no-op that reads as success while no tray was ever going to appear. The only
  route was knowing to run `scripts/build-desktop-tray.ps1` by hand, and even
  then the companion vanished at the next reboot. `install.ps1 -WithTray` (and
  `-NoTray`, matching `install.sh`) now builds it and registers a `Codex Router
  Tray` logon task, kept separate from the router's own task so stopping one
  never takes the other down. Quitting from the tray menu stays quit: the
  restart setting covers a crash, not a clean exit. A platform with no
  supervisor now says so on stderr rather than reporting success, and the
  guidance names the `^` overflow that hides new tray icons on Windows 11.

- **Windows stops mistaking its own spawn failures for provider problems.** A
  command resolved on Windows and a command Windows can spawn are two different
  things: `where.exe` lists the extensionless npm shim first, and Node has
  refused to run a `.cmd` shim without a shell since CVE-2024-27980. Four
  copies of the same lookup helper took line one anyway, and the spawn errors
  that followed were each read as something else. The official Grok CLI was the
  worst of it — a healthy npm install failed to launch, raising the same
  `spawn UNKNOWN` that Smart App Control raises, so the router announced that
  Windows application control had blocked it and told the operator to give up
  on OAuth and use an API key. Even had the preflight passed, the token refresh
  behind it spawned the shim the same unusable way.

  Resolution and launching now live in one module and are used everywhere:
  the routed-subagent proof run (which hands Codex a whole sentence, so it
  cannot go through a shell that joins arguments on spaces), the Codex account
  usage panel, the doctor's Codex configuration probe, the `npm install -g` and
  sign-in paths for provider CLIs, and the precedence probe. Arguments are
  escaped for `cmd.exe` rather than concatenated, so a path under
  `C:\Program Files` and a prompt containing spaces both survive.

- **Three more Windows-only breakages in the same family.** The Codex account
  usage panel kept a private two-line search for the CLI — an undocumented
  environment variable, a macOS-only path, then the bare name — which finds
  nothing on Windows, so the panel reported "the Codex app-server could not be
  started" on every machine; it now uses the shared discovery and kills the
  process tree rather than leaking a Codex process per poll. `control apply`
  ran the POSIX `bin/enable` script, which Windows cannot execute, and now
  takes the PowerShell installer that `doctor --fix` already uses. The
  vision-model download worker was the one detached child without
  `windowsHide`, so it opened a console window for the length of a
  multi-gigabyte pull.

- **A local Ollama the router could find is one it can also run.** The vision
  host probed for Ollama through the runtime's known install locations but then
  spawned the bare name, so a Windows install under `%LOCALAPPDATA%` reported
  as available and failed at the next call. Both now use the same resolver.

- **Routed models that emit integer tool arguments as JSON floats no longer
  get those calls rejected by Codex.** Grok 4.6 was sending
  `timeout_ms: 20000.0`; Codex's native `shell_command` schema wants a `u64`,
  so every agentic turn died before the command ran. The response rewrite now
  turns whole-number tokens into integers on the way back, including native
  tools that are not namespaced. Genuine fractions are left alone.

## 0.4.0-beta.3

- **The usage panel shows what is left of your plan for xAI OAuth, MiniMax,
  Command Code, and opencode Go.** MiniMax reads its coding-plan remains
  endpoint (interval and weekly windows), Command Code reads the same billing
  credits route its official CLI polls (5-hour and weekly windows), and
  opencode Go reads its usage endpoint (rolling, weekly, and monthly windows,
  shared across the protocol variants). A fresh xAI weekly window arrives with
  its zero usage omitted from the wire format, which used to read as
  "unavailable" instead of everything left — a billing period with no percent
  now reads as 0% used. Every fetcher refuses to send the credential anywhere
  but the provider's own host, and any failure degrades to the previous
  router-traffic view.

- **The subagent list shows only models you can actually pick.** Hidden models
  rendered as permanently locked rows; they are filtered out, with a note
  giving the hidden count and pointing at the picker section that brings them
  back. Toolbar labels name the setting they change, both surfaces note that
  subagent choices never hide models from Codex's picker, and the tray's two
  look-alike provider panels no longer expand in lockstep.

- **A failed request names its cause all the way down.** The transport reports
  every connection-level failure as a bare `TypeError: fetch failed` with the
  code that says why buried on the cause chain, which left repeated native
  failures unexplainable from the retained log. The router and every forwarder
  now log the whole chain — names and codes only where a failure can wrap
  upstream response text. Name-resolution and local-resource failures
  (`ENOTFOUND`, `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, `ENOBUFS`) joined the retryable set, since
  all three fail before a connection exists. Every native failure now records
  a usage event, so a 502 without one can no longer hide inside the router,
  and an uncaught crash exits with its own code (95/94) and full chain in the
  log, so a supervisor's exit line alone distinguishes an in-process crash
  from an external kill.

- **One union-rooted tool schema no longer kills every xAI OAuth turn.** xAI
  rejects the whole request when any tool's parameter schema roots in an
  `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf` union, and Codex's own automation tool ships one —
  so a Grok session that never touched automations still died on its first
  message. Union roots are flattened into a single object schema (branch
  properties merged, `required` narrowed to what every branch demands) and
  object-rooted schemas pass through untouched.

- **GitHub Copilot is available as a catalog-only provider.** A
  fine-grained PAT with the Copilot Requests permission is validated through
  the Copilot account endpoint; account-selected inference hosts are restricted
  to GitHub-owned Copilot hosts, and account routing is refreshed once on a 401
  before any bytes are relayed. Live discovery exposes only
  account-visible Responses models that advertise streaming and tool calls, so
  plans and organization policy remain authoritative. Setup, doctor, both tray
  implementations, quota reporting, curation, and credential redaction all use
  the same provider path. Account discovery keeps GitHub authoritative as its
  model and inference interfaces evolve.

- **The reader is asked what you actually want to know, and asked again when
  that changes.** The question used to be pinned to the image's own message, so
  an image's reading was fixed by the first thing ever asked about it. Paste a
  photo, ask "what is this?", and a reader under orders to describe rather than
  identify answered "a lake at dusk" — after which the model went to the
  filesystem, then to reverse image search, and uploaded the screenshot to a
  public image host to get an answer the vision model could have given in a
  line. Now the newest image follows the newest question.

  It is still bought once per *question*, never once per turn, so Codex
  resending the whole conversation between turns costs nothing — and only the
  newest image follows the conversation, so a chat holding ten screenshots
  cannot turn one new question into ten new reads. Earlier readings are kept, so
  the answer to your first question is still in front of the model when you ask
  your second.

- **The reader may say what something is.** A new `## Identification` section:
  the place, product, application, chart type, or well-known image it
  recognizes, with its confidence and what in the picture supports it. It is
  the one section where inference is allowed — `## Text` stays verbatim, and an
  unrecognizable image says `(unrecognized)` rather than guessing.

- **One unreachable engine no longer costs you the image.** Resolving an engine
  and reaching it are different questions, and the bridge conflated them: a
  pinned engine that resolved and then answered 401 because a session lapsed,
  or 503 because the provider's endpoint was down, left every paste degrading
  to "could not be read" until somebody noticed. Both happened within an hour of
  testing. The reader is now a short list — your chosen engine first, then the
  other credentialed vision models — and the image is offered to the next one
  when the first cannot be reached. Verified live with a genuinely dead engine
  pinned first: all ten test images were still read.

  Nothing extra is spent when your engine works, since a second engine is only
  called after the first has failed. It is not silent: the evidence names
  whichever engine actually did the reading and the log line records the
  fallback. A pin that does not resolve at all is still an operator-visible
  problem rather than a quiet switch, and a pinned local engine never falls back
  onto a provider's quota you did not choose to spend. Another provider is tried
  before another attempt at a broken one, which cut a degraded read from 30–52s
  to 12–35s.

- **A read that fails once is asked again.** The engine is a rate-limited
  account across a network, so a 429, a 502, a reset connection, or an empty
  reply used to cost you that image for the whole turn. Those are retried twice,
  250ms then 1s. A refusal is not: 400, 401, 403 and 404 buy the identical
  refusal a second time, and a timeout is reported rather than retried, because
  the per-attempt budget is already two minutes. A local engine that is down
  still reports the transport's own words, which is how you learn your own
  server is not running.

- **The gateway no longer installs a cryptography with a known advisory.**
  litellm 1.95.0 required `cryptography>=48.0.1,<49.0`, and the fix for
  GHSA-g6cj-pr64-35w5 — a Bleichenbacher oracle reachable through PKCS#7
  EnvelopedData decryption — landed in 50.0.0, so the patched version could not
  be resolved at all while that pin was held. litellm moves to 1.96.0, which
  allows `cryptography>=49.0.0,<51.0`, and the lock now carries 50.0.0. Nothing
  else moves except `litellm-enterprise`.

  The fastapi cap stays at 0.139.2. litellm 1.96.0 declares `fastapi<1.0` but
  still imports `get_flat_dependant`, which 0.140 removed, so a resolve that
  looks clean produces a gateway that dies on startup — verified by booting the
  proxy on both pins rather than by trusting the resolver. macOS installs get
  faster as a side effect: 1.96.0 publishes macOS wheels, where 1.95.0 had to be
  built from the sdist with a Rust toolchain.

- **An image the model fetched for itself is read too.** The bridge walked user
  messages only, so a pasted screenshot was transcribed and the turn still
  failed: the paste carries the file's path as text, the text-only model
  reached for Codex's `view_image` tool on it, and the tool result came back
  holding the same megabytes of image the bridge had just paid to read. The
  provider rejected the whole conversation (`unknown variant image_url`) with
  no mention of an image. Tool results are now read on the same terms as
  messages — and for the question that led to them, so the second read of the
  same screenshot is served from the transcript cache rather than bought again.
  Text-only models can now read image files on disk as well as pastes, which
  fell out of the same fix.

- **A transcript says which file it is of, so the model stops fetching what it
  already has.** A paste carries the image and its path, and nothing connected
  the two: the model was handed a full reading and then spent a tool call and an
  entire resend of the conversation opening the file itself — far more than the
  read cost. The evidence header now names the path and says the reading is
  complete. Codex's `<image …>` wrapper is markup rather than anything you
  asked, so it no longer travels to the vision engine as part of your question.

- **One image asked one question is bought once, however many requests are in
  flight.** The transcript cache only knew about reads that had finished, so
  concurrent turns — Codex sends them, and a subagent runs beside its parent —
  all missed and all paid. Measured on a real install: one pasted screenshot,
  two overlapping reads, three seconds apart. Reads now share, and the images in
  one turn are read concurrently under a cap rather than one after another, so a
  turn with five screenshots waits for the slowest instead of the sum.

- **What the router knows about an image accumulates instead of resetting.** A
  transcript used to be filed under the question that bought it, and only that
  one was ever injected — so an image's evidence was a snapshot of the first
  thing you asked about it. Ask "what colour is this?" and a later "what does
  the text say?" got the colour-focused reading back, with no way to ever add to
  it. The record is now per image: a later read appends, and every turn sees
  everything the router has learned about that picture. Records are capped, and
  the first, general reading is never the one dropped.

  The same image appearing twice in a turn — the paste and the tool result that
  fetched it — now prints its reading once, with the second slot pointing at the
  first. That is keyed on the image itself, never on transcripts that happen to
  match, so two screenshots that read alike are still two images.

- **An image sent straight to the gateway no longer dies at the provider.** The
  API forwarder sits downstream of the gateway, so Codex's own turns arrive
  already bridged — but a client talking to the gateway directly could hand a
  text-only model an image and get back a 400 naming a JSON variant, which reads
  as a router bug. Those parts are now replaced with a stated failure that says
  where the bridge actually lives. Reading them there is deliberately not
  offered: the engine call would re-enter the gateway holding that very request.

- **An incomplete reading says so.** A transcript that came back missing its
  required sections, or truncated at the router's size limit, is labelled as
  partial — and that is the only time the model is told it can look again. Left
  unsaid, a model cannot tell "the image does not show that" from "the
  transcript does not mention it", and it answers the first with confidence
  either way.

- **A text-only model reads a pasted image with no configuration.** The vision
  bridge is now on by default: paste a screenshot into DeepSeek, GLM, or Kimi
  and it is transcribed by the cheapest vision-capable model you have already
  enabled — or by your signed-in ChatGPT plan — instead of silently doing
  nothing until you discovered a toggle. An install with nothing to read images
  with behaves exactly as it did before: no engine resolves, the picker keeps
  saying text-only, and Codex keeps refusing the paste.

  Turning it off is permanent. The state file's *presence* is what separates
  "never configured" from "configured off", so a stored `enabled: false` is
  never re-enabled by this change or any future one, and a state file this
  build cannot parse falls back to off rather than to the new default. The
  installer no longer writes bridge state at all; it only reports what will
  happen.

  Two things it will not do on its own. It never picks an engine served from
  your own machine — the pinned `local` engine, or a model from the keyless
  `local` provider — because your runtime may not be running and that would
  fail every paste; pin one and it is used gladly. And it no longer spends
  quota invisibly: every read that misses the transcript cache records a usage
  event naming the engine it was billed to, and the per-turn log line is no
  longer suppressed on an unattended service. A ChatGPT-plan engine's quota is
  still not reflected in the tray's limits.

- **A curated model can say it refuses a forced tool choice.** A few upstreams
  call tools happily when `tool_choice` is `"auto"` and answer HTTP 400 when
  one is required, so the compatibility check reported no tool support and the
  routed-subagent handoff failed on a model whose tool calling was fine. The
  vendor profiles already covered DeepSeek and Qwen on their own endpoints;
  reached through a reseller like OpenRouter the same model had nowhere to
  declare it, because those providers ship no registry models to inherit a
  profile from. Curation now asks, and stores `auto-tool-choice`
  (`--request-profile auto-tool-choice` in the `--models` form), which
  downgrades the forced choice for that model and touches no other parameter.
  It stays per model on purpose: OpenRouter reports `tool_choice` support per
  model in its own catalog, so downgrading for a whole reseller would let
  models that honor a forced choice quietly decline both the probe and the
  subagent relay's forced function call. The probe itself still sends
  `required`. Thanks to @jepgambardella for the report.

- **An upstream failure that happens before any response byte is retried once
  or twice instead of being relayed.** ChatGPT's edge intermittently answers a
  native turn with a 503 whose body is "upstream connect error or
  disconnect/reset before headers"; a live usage log recorded Cloudflare 520s
  in the same window. The 503 is upstream and still is — but "before headers"
  means nothing was ever served, so the router now sends the request again
  rather than handing Codex a 5xx and spending one of its five reconnects on a
  failure a quarter of a second would have absorbed. Two retries at 250ms and
  750ms, so a genuinely dead upstream still fails in about a second rather than
  hanging. Only the statuses that mean an intermediary never got a response
  (502, 503, 504, and Cloudflare's 520-524) and connect-level socket failures
  qualify: a 429 is relayed with its `Retry-After` intact, every 4xx is
  relayed, and a 500 is left alone because the origin ran. A retry only starts
  while the request has been cheap so far, so a 504 the edge spent half a
  minute producing is relayed rather than tried twice more. Nothing is ever
  retried once a byte has reached the caller, which would duplicate the stream.
  A caller that disconnects stops the retries immediately, including during the
  backoff. Retries are logged whether or not the service is quiet, and recorded
  on the usage event, so an upstream that is being papered over still looks
  flaky in the telemetry instead of healthy.

- **A provider that reports no prompt tokens no longer disables compaction.**
  Codex decides when to auto-compact from the `input_tokens` each response
  reports. opencode's Go endpoint stopped reporting them for its DeepSeek V4
  models, so the context counter never climbed, compaction never fired, and
  sessions ran until the provider itself refused the turn — one captured turn
  carried 1,050,034 tokens against a 1,048,576-token limit, with the context
  bar still showing nearly empty. When a routed response now explicitly claims
  zero prompt tokens for a request the router just measured as large, the
  router substitutes an estimate of the prompt it sent, so Codex compacts on
  time. The estimate errs high on purpose: compaction sits 14% below the hard
  limit, so an estimate that lands low would let the turn die anyway, while a
  high one only compacts sooner. Nothing else is touched — a provider that
  reports correctly, a response with no usage block, and native traffic all
  pass through byte for byte, and the substitution stops by itself once the
  upstream starts reporting again. It is never silent: the usage event keeps
  the provider's own counts and adds `estimatedInputTokens` beside them, and
  the turn logs `estimated-input-tokens=<count>`, so estimated turns can never
  be mistaken for the provider having recovered.

- **You can now see which local models to download.** Installing one required
  knowing its tag by heart: the tray's only entry point was a free-text field,
  and every command took a tag as an argument, so anyone who had never
  installed a local model had nowhere to start. `local-models list` and the
  tray's Local LLMs panel now offer a shortlist rated against this machine's
  memory, with tool support stated per entry — it decides whether Codex can
  drive the model at all, and several popular coding models turn out not to
  have it. Anything already downloaded drops off the list. `list` also renders
  for a person now instead of printing one long JSON line; `--json` keeps the
  machine-readable form.

- **A local model is now checked against the machine before it downloads.**
  Installing one asked whether Codex could drive it but never whether the
  machine could run it, so a 65 GB pull could finish on a laptop that can never
  load it. The registry manifest already carries the size, so the same lookup
  now also rates fit against detected memory — unified memory on Apple Silicon,
  GPU memory where NVIDIA reports it, system RAM otherwise, allowing ~20% above
  the weights for context and cache. `inspect` reports `fits`, `tight`, or
  `too-large`; `install` refuses a `too-large` model before transferring
  anything unless `--yes` overrides it, and warns on a `tight` one.

- **The doctor stopped telling the local provider to store an API key.** Its
  provider loop labelled every row "<name> key" and offered `provider-key ...
  set` as the fix — a command the keyless local provider refuses. The
  empty-picker warning also claimed a "key stored" that never existed and
  pointed at `curate-models`, which is the remote-catalog flow rather than the
  download-and-check one local models use. The row is named for the endpoint
  now, and both fixes name commands that work.

- **The macOS tray lists every provider, not just the ones already working.**
  Its Providers section built rows by grouping the models in the picker, so a
  provider shipping none had no row — hiding the local provider and all ten
  catalog-only services in the one place built to configure them. Rows now come
  from the router's registry snapshot.

- **The Windows and Linux tray can toggle providers added after it shipped.**
  Its provider allowlist was a hardcoded six-entry list, so everything added
  since — the local provider included — failed with "Unknown provider." It now
  validates the id's shape and lets the registry decide what exists.

- **Windows no longer opens a console window at logon.** The scheduled task ran
  the CMD wrapper through `cmd.exe`, so a console window appeared at every logon
  and stayed for the router's lifetime, reappearing on each watchdog restart.
  The task now runs a generated VBS launcher under `wscript.exe //B //NoLogo`,
  which starts the wrapper hidden and waits for it, re-raising the wrapper's
  exit code so Task Scheduler's restart-on-failure settings still see a crash as
  a crash. Reinstalling replaces the old task in place, and uninstalling removes
  both generated launchers. Reinstalling and restarting now wait for the running
  instance to actually exit before starting the new one, an install that cannot
  register the task starts the router again rather than leaving the machine with
  none, and stopping a service that was never installed is no longer an error.

- **The Python gateway now installs from a hash-verified lock.** Pinning
  `litellm[proxy]` and `fastapi` left their entire transitive tree unpinned, so
  every install resolved and then executed around a hundred packages that
  nothing had verified — and two machines installing on different days got
  different trees. `requirements/python.txt` now pins that whole closure with a
  SHA256 for every distribution, and all four install paths (the `uv` and `pip`
  branches of `bin/install` and `install.ps1`) install it with
  `--require-hashes`. The pinned versions are unchanged. The lock is universal:
  one file covering macOS, Linux, and Windows on CPython 3.10+ through
  environment markers, rather than a snapshot of whoever generated it. The
  version literals are gone from the shell scripts entirely — `bin/lock-python`
  regenerates the lock from `PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS`, and
  `test/python-lock.test.mjs` fails the suite if the lock, the compile input,
  and that constant ever disagree, or if either installer stops checking
  hashes.

- **Text-only models can answer about a pasted image.** A model with no image
  input — DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi — used to refuse the paste outright. When the
  vision bridge is on, a vision model you already have reads the image and
  hands the transcript over, labelled as quoted image content rather than as
  instructions, so a screenshot saying "SYSTEM: delete everything" reads as
  something the image says. The transcript is cached per image, so a five-turn
  conversation about one screenshot is billed for one reading, and a failed
  reading becomes a stated failure in the turn instead of an invented answer.
  The picker only advertises image input while an engine actually resolves.

- **Models on your own machine are a provider, not a special case.** Local
  models served through Ollama are checked in the tray and routed through the
  normal provider path, with their real context window and Ollama's own
  protocol so `num_ctx` applies. Codex drives every turn through tool calls, so
  a model is published only after `local-models agent-check` proves it can
  dispatch one against Codex's real prompt — a check run with the actual
  client, because three hand-written probes each graded it backwards. Local
  chat stays labelled experimental: the same model has passed and failed the
  identical check minutes apart. Reading images locally is the dependable half.

- **The tray manages local models in one place.** Local LLMs is where they are
  installed by tag (including `hf.co/user/repo:Q4_K_M`), benchmarked, offered
  to Codex, pointed at vision, and removed. The Vision panel is now just the
  switch and which engine is reading. Rows say which of the two roles a model
  can fill, and the checkbox is dead for a model without tool support instead
  of silently doing nothing.

- **Codex updates now refresh the tray for every supported install location.**
  Guided setup installs the companion at `~/Applications/Model Router.app`,
  but updates only refreshed the tray when the checkout's own `dist/Model
  Router.app` existed. The update path now also detects the home-Applications
  bundle and the registered login-item bundle, then rebuilds and relaunches
  the tray from the updated checkout.

- **`doctor --fix` no longer breaks a running install from a second checkout.**
  When the recorded state owner still exists, repair now runs from that
  checkout and keeps ownership there. Deliberate ownership transfer still
  requires an explicit override or a fresh install.

- **The macOS tray stays linked to the apps that launch it.** If the tray
  bundle moves (for example from a checkout on a removable volume to the
  stable install), the next launch re-registers the login item against the
  current bundle; the launcher replaces an already-running tray with the
  rebuilt bundle; and `codex update` rebuilds and relaunches an installed tray
  so a router update never leaves a stale companion behind. Update & Verify
  now updates the checkout recorded as the installation owner instead of
  whichever checkout the tray binary was built from.

- **A busy machine no longer fails startup on services that are working.**
  Each health probe was abandoned after a flat second, and a probe we gave up
  on counted exactly like a refused connection. Under the fork and exec
  contention of a login — when a build or a sync starts at the same moment as
  the router — a forwarder that had printed `listening` at 1.4 s answered every
  probe later than that, so all of them aborted, the budget ran out, and
  startup reported `Timed out waiting for API forwarder to become healthy`
  about a service that was fine. The probe window now widens from 1 s to a 10 s
  cap, and the two outcomes are told apart: nothing listening on loopback
  refuses instantly, so a refusal still backs off (a cold-starting gateway must
  not flood its own access log), while an abort is retried at once with a wider
  window, because the window it already spent is backoff enough and gives no
  evidence the service is dead. A timeout now also says which of the two it
  saw. A service that genuinely died is still reported the same way it always
  was, by the exit check between the probe and the sleep: waking that sleep from
  the child's own exit callback would report it sooner, and kills the process on
  Windows with a libuv assertion while it is reporting the failure it had
  already diagnosed correctly.

## 0.4.0-beta.2

- **Updates stop reinstalling dependencies that never changed.** Every update
  re-ran the whole installer, so a commit that touched one `.mjs` file still
  wiped `node_modules` for a fresh `npm ci` and re-resolved the entire
  `litellm[proxy]` tree against PyPI — which pulled unpinned transitive
  upgrades and, on a cold uv cache or a slow link, dominated the run. Both
  installers now fingerprint each dependency step (the lockfile for Node, the
  pinned requirement set plus the installed distribution versions for Python)
  and skip it when the artifacts already match, recording the stamp next to
  `node_modules/` and `.venv/` so deleting either one reinstalls. Repair still
  rebuilds everything: `doctor --fix` passes `--force-deps` (`-ForceDeps` on
  Windows), which fingerprints cannot know about a corrupted tree. The
  LiteLLM and FastAPI pins now live in `src/install-plan.mjs`, and a test
  fails if either installer's copy drifts.

- **`update check` no longer performs the update.** The `bin/update` wrapper
  hardcoded the `update` subcommand, so the read-only availability check was
  unreachable from the CLI and asking "is there a new version?" reinstalled
  the router instead. Both `bin/update` and `codex-router.ps1 update` now
  forward the subcommand, and a bare invocation still updates.

- **Reasoning efforts now match what the installed Codex build can display.**
  Codex's picker parses effort levels into a fixed enum and silently drops
  values it does not recognize; `max` and `ultra` only joined that enum in
  Codex 0.143.0, so on older builds the `max` tiers curated for several
  models simply vanished from the effort menu (GLM-5.2 lost its second tier,
  DeepSeek V4 Flash showed two levels instead of three). The catalog now
  derives the supported vocabulary from the installed Codex version and
  republishes out-of-range efforts at the nearest supported tier (`max` →
  `xhigh`), keeping defaults and announcement copy in range. Routing is
  unchanged — the forwarder already folds `xhigh` back to each vendor's
  documented maximum.

- **Legacy opencode Go models now offer Codex's native migration prompt.**
  GLM-5.1, Kimi K2.6, and MiniMax M2.7 carry an `upgradeTo` entry pointing at
  their generational successor on the same subscription (GLM-5.2, Kimi K3,
  MiniMax M3), so operators still running the older model get the
  full-screen "upgrade" modal and can switch their default with one accept —
  the older models stay in the picker. Upgrade targets are now validated at
  registry load: a checked-in prompt pointing at a missing or unlisted slug
  fails the build, and a user-curated one is skipped with a warning instead
  of shipping a modal that can never render.

- **New models announce themselves in Codex.** Checked-in models that newly
  become routable — shipped by a router update, or unlocked the moment their
  provider is credentialed and enabled — now carry Codex's native
  "Introducing {model}" announcement for seven days, with copy assembled from
  their verified picker metadata (context window, effort ladder, image
  input). The first catalog capture seeds the tracking state silently so an
  install never announces the whole catalog, locally curated models never
  self-announce, and Codex's own per-model show cap still applies. Curators
  can override the generated copy with an `availabilityNux` string on the
  registry entry, and a new `upgradeTo` field (`{ model, markdown }`) drives
  Codex's full-screen migration prompt for a genuine successor model —
  accepting it switches the operator's default model, so it is reserved for
  deliberate hand-offs.

- **Adapted the managed `[agents]` concurrency default to the installed Codex
  build.** Some Codex builds (observed on 0.141-0.145) parse `[agents]` as a
  pure role map and refuse to load any config containing the scalar, which
  broke `codex login status` and `codex doctor` outright. The config manager
  now probes the installed binary with a minimal config before writing the
  scalar and skips it when the build rejects it, so builds that accept the
  scalar keep the concurrency cap and strict builds keep a loadable config.
- **Re-captured the native model catalog when the Codex build changes.** The
  cached capture now records the Codex version that produced it and is
  refreshed from `codex debug models` on mismatch, so a catalog captured by an
  older build no longer feeds missing or stale capability fields (such as
  `supports_reasoning_summaries`) into the merged catalog after an upgrade. If
  the re-capture fails, the router keeps serving the previous capture and says
  so instead of failing the rebuild.

- **Reasoning effort ladders now match each vendor's documentation.** Every
  listed model's picker levels were verified against the provider's official
  API docs: Kimi K3 (API) gains its documented low/high/max ladder instead of
  a forced max; DeepSeek V4 Flash gains its real low tier; Claude Opus 4.8
  gains the full low/medium/high/xhigh/max `output_config.effort` ladder and
  the forwarder now passes the picked effort through instead of hardcoding
  high; GLM-5.2 sends its two documented tiers explicitly (upstream defaults
  to max when the parameter is omitted) and defaults to max as Z.ai
  recommends; GLM-5-Turbo no longer advertises effort control it does not
  support; and the cross-vendor DeepSeek/GLM models resold through the
  Alibaba plan gain the high/max ladder DashScope documents for them.
  The opencode Go models take their ladders from opencode's own model
  registry (Grok low/medium/high; GLM-5.2 and DeepSeek V4 Pro high/max;
  DeepSeek V4 Flash low/high/max; HY3 low/high; Kimi K3 max-only; GPT 5.6
  Luna low through max), passed through verbatim since the gateway validates
  these values itself. Providers whose thinking control is binary or
  undocumented (Qwen via DashScope, Ollama Cloud, MiniMax, MiMo, Kimi K2.x)
  intentionally keep a single level.

- **Curated models now carry user-provided metadata, including reasoning
  efforts.** `bin/curate-models` asks for each new model's context window,
  image support, and reasoning efforts (so curated models get the effort
  switcher in the Codex picker), with `--efforts` available for the
  non-interactive `--models` form. Every value defaults conservatively and
  stays editable in `user-models.json`. No online metadata catalog is
  consulted — the provider's own `/v1/models` endpoint decides which models
  exist, and the metadata is yours.

- **New Meta Model API provider.** The `meta` provider (shown as "Meta API")
  routes the Responses protocol to `https://api.meta.ai/v1` with a stored
  `META_API_KEY`. Three Muse Spark models ship in the registry: 1.2, its
  cheaper 1.2 Contributor tier (whose inputs and outputs Meta may use for
  training), and the previous-generation 1.1 — the 1.2 tiers with reasoning
  summaries enabled. More Meta models can be curated per machine with
  `bin/curate-models meta`.

- **opencode Go is one provider family everywhere.** The
  `opencode-go-messages` and `opencode-go-responses` protocol variants now
  declare `variantOf: "opencode-go"` in the registry, and provider selection
  treats the three as a single unit: enabling or disabling any of them toggles
  the whole family, the selection file stores only `opencode-go`, and every
  read expands it back to all variants. This retroactively fixes installs
  whose selection predates the variants — MiniMax, Qwen, and GPT 5.6 Luna
  models no longer vanish from the Codex picker while the other opencode Go
  models show. Setup, the tray, and `providers list` now show one
  **opencode Go** entry instead of three.

- **Removed the Cursor and opencode app targets.** The router now focuses on
  Codex only: `--target codex` is the sole installer target, the Cursor Chat
  Completions gateway and the opencode config manager/subagent generator are
  gone, and their port blocks (4104-4107, 4116, 4120-4126) are released. The
  opencode Go model subscription is unaffected — it remains a regular provider
  inside Codex. Anyone with a previously installed Cursor or opencode
  integration can remove the old service with that checkout's
  `model-router <target> uninstall` before updating.

- A **Show tray** mode in the macOS tray's Settings tab can tie the menu bar
  icon, Dynamic Island, and desktop panel to the Codex/ChatGPT desktop apps:
  the surfaces appear when either app launches and hide when the last one
  quits, while the tray process stays resident as the watcher. The default
  remains always-visible.

- The macOS tray registers itself as a login item on its first launch, so it
  reopens automatically after a reboot instead of requiring a manual
  `./bin/model-router-tray`. A **Start at login** toggle in the Settings tab
  (backed by `SMAppService`, also visible in System Settings › Login Items)
  controls it, and the automatic registration happens only once — disabling
  the item is never overridden.

- The opencode target now generates one subagent per selected model in
  opencode's config, and refreshes those entries when providers are enabled,
  disabled, or given new keys. `setup`, `doctor`, `status`, `enable`, `disable`,
  and `uninstall` all support `MODEL_ROUTER_TARGET=opencode` through
  `bin/model-router opencode ...`, and the opencode installer works from both
  `install.sh --target opencode` and `install.ps1 -Target opencode`.

- Fixed native OpenAI models disappearing from the Codex picker on Windows when
  the Codex CLI is installed through npm (#46). `where.exe codex` lists the
  extensionless POSIX shim before `codex.cmd`, and Node cannot spawn the former
  without a shell, so every probe threw ENOENT. The router now picks a shim Node
  can execute and runs `.cmd`/`.bat` through a shell with the path quoted.
- A Codex binary that cannot be spawned is no longer reported as a signed-out
  session. That conflation is what let one spawn error silently strip every
  native model from the catalog; the catalog build now refuses to run rather
  than guess, and the doctor reports the probe failure on its own line.

- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is documented as a `qwen-plan` credential alongside
  `QWEN_PLAN_API_KEY`, and the README now records that Qwen is key-only:
  Alibaba discontinued the Qwen Code OAuth free tier on 2026-04-15, so there is
  no OAuth path to add. Point `QWEN_PLAN_BASE_URL` at the DashScope
  compatible-mode endpoint to bill a pay-as-you-go key through the same
  provider.

- The Alibaba Model Studio plan provider (`qwen-plan`) now lists every chat
  model the Individual Plan serves, not just Qwen3.7: Qwen3.8 Max, Qwen3.8 Max
  Preview and Qwen3.6 Flash (all with vision input), plus the cross-vendor
  models the plan resells — DeepSeek V4 Pro, DeepSeek V4 Flash (0731) and
  GLM-5.2. The cross-vendor entries use the DashScope compatible-mode request
  profile rather than each vendor's native thinking profile, because DashScope
  rejects the vendor-specific parameters. The plan's speech, image and video
  models are deliberately not listed — they are not chat-completions models
  and would fail on every request from a model picker.

- API keys can now be replaced or removed from the desktop app and the macOS
  tray, not just the terminal. Each connected API provider gains a **Replace
  key** action and a confirmed **Remove** action; removing deletes the managed
  key files and hides the provider from the Codex model picker. If a key is
  also present in the macOS Keychain or the environment, the removal result
  says where it still resolves from instead of claiming a clean disconnect.
  `control credential <provider> --remove` exposes the same operation.

- The Dynamic Island setting is now a three-way mode: Off, Notch (the
  existing top-of-screen overlay), or Desktop — a draggable widget-style
  panel pinned just above the desktop icons that always shows live router
  activity, every connected provider's vendor quota bars with reset
  countdowns, and the 7-day token trend, with its position remembered.
- Added a Z.ai vendor quota adapter: when a `zai-coding` provider is
  configured, account usage now reports real plan windows (5-hour, weekly,
  token quota) with reset times from Z.ai's key-authenticated quota API,
  plus a dashboard link. Alibaba plan and Ollama Cloud accounts stay
  local-only by design — their vendor dashboards are session-gated and the
  router never imports browser cookies — but now carry a `dashboardUrl` so
  companion UIs can deep-link to the official usage pages.
- Service startup failures now include the underlying bounded, non-sensitive
  error message (for example which health check timed out or which service
  exited early) instead of a generic failure line.
- Canceling a generation (or any client disconnect mid-request) no longer
  flips router health into the eight-second error state, so tray and island
  status indicators stop flashing red on ordinary cancels. Errors the router
  or an upstream actually produced still surface.
- The hidden API-key prompt now confirms how many characters were captured
  after each entry, challenges input that looks like the same key pasted
  twice before saving, and re-prompts instead of failing on empty input, so a
  paste with terminal echo disabled is no longer a silent leap of faith.
- Guided setup now offers to build and launch the desktop companion app as a
  final step on macOS (menu bar, installed into `~/Applications`) and Linux
  (tray), with `--with-tray`/`--no-tray` overrides on `install.sh` and
  `bin/setup`. A missing toolchain or failed build warns and continues; it
  never fails the router install.
- Added an Ollama Cloud provider (`ollama-cloud`) with GLM-5.2, Kimi K2.7
  Code, MiniMax M3, and DeepSeek V4 Pro picker models, using ollama.com's
  OpenAI-compatible API with an account API key and context windows read from
  Ollama's published model metadata.
- Added a Qwen provider (`qwen-plan`) for Alibaba Model Studio Token and
  Coding Plan subscriptions with Qwen3.7 Max and Qwen3.7 Plus picker models,
  defaulting to the Singapore Token Plan endpoint with an environment override
  for other regions or plans.
- Added a Z.ai GLM Coding Plan provider (`zai-coding`) with GLM-5.2 and
  GLM-5-Turbo picker models. Requests use the plan's dedicated coding endpoint,
  enable thinking, map Codex's maximum reasoning tier to Z.ai's `max` effort,
  and drop sampling overrides that conflict with thinking mode.
- Added interactive model curation: `bin/curate-models PROVIDER` discovers the
  provider's live model list, lets the user toggle models the registry does
  not ship, and stores them as protected local user models with conservative
  default metadata. User models overlay the registry at load time; invalid or
  colliding entries are skipped with warnings instead of failing the router,
  and the command can rebuild routes and restart the service on request.
- Rebuilt the guided setup as a stepped wizard: numbered progress headers, a
  toggleable provider list with live ready/needs-key/needs-sign-in status,
  `a`/`n` select-all/none shortcuts, invalid-input recovery instead of
  aborting, color when the terminal supports it (respecting `NO_COLOR`), and a
  review summary with explicit confirmation before anything is installed.
- Guided Codex setup can now onboard Grok OAuth (and offers to `npm install`
  a missing official provider CLI), matching what the Cursor setup and tray
  already supported.
- Added a reversible tray toggle that lets signed-out Codex CLI/App sessions
  use connected external providers through a managed custom model provider,
  while preserving ChatGPT credentials and restoring the prior provider mode.
- The macOS login-free toggle now gracefully restarts the registered Codex app
  after applying or restoring its model-provider mode.
- Grok OAuth injects bare hosted `web_search` and `x_search` tools so xAI can
  run server-side realtime search agentically, matching Grok Build. Router-side
  search env filters and request search-parameter mapping were removed.
- Use Thinking Orbs `Shaping` while idle, `Thinking` while generating, and
  `Solving` for the Island's error indicator.
- Replace compact provider names with the providers' published marks and Codex
  session titles, add a plain `+N` concurrent-session indicator, and show dark
  hover rows with live status, elapsed time, daily usage, and ping-pong overflow
  for long titles.
- Added a native Windows and Linux tray companion with a seven-day token graph,
  connected-provider quota cards, secure onboarding, an animated top-center
  activity pill on Windows/X11, and an explicit tray-only Wayland fallback.
- Balanced the Dynamic Island with an animated status dot and slow idle
  heartbeat, a clearer localized pulse and edge comet during generation, and a
  one-shot line-chart draw while preserving Reduce Motion behavior.
- Restored the Dynamic Island's daily line graph with today's token total and
  provider quota percentage, while leaving longer-range controls in the tray.
- Hide tray usage cards until the corresponding OAuth session or API key is
  configured; enabled providers and historical local traffic no longer create
  disconnected-account cards.
- Cleaned up tray quota cards so each window has one standardized limit label
  and one reset line, with five-hour windows shown separately from weekly
  limits in both current and all-provider usage.
- Fixed All usage cards so local traffic with request counts no longer shows
  "No use", and local-only providers show "Local router traffic" instead of
  "No reset reported".
- Surface concurrent Codex model requests on the Dynamic Island: active count,
  multi-provider compact labels, and live request rows with elapsed time.
- Added a credential-isolated Anthropic API provider with Claude Opus 4.8 in
  the Codex picker, native Anthropic Messages forwarding, secure key setup,
  tray controls, and a real LiteLLM-to-mock-Anthropic Codex integration test.
- Added the macOS menu-bar control panel, all-provider usage grid, and optional
  Dynamic-Island-style activity overlay with secure provider onboarding.
- Made tray usage selection account-aware, added quota reset times to provider
  cards, and kept Kimi and Grok OAuth sessions fresh during usage polling and
  routed requests.
- Made macOS service reinstalls wait for launchd to finish unloading and use an
  in-place restart, preventing transient bootstrap status-5 failures.
- Serialized background-service changes and added bounded readiness checks so
  repairs cannot overlap or report failure while a healthy router is starting.
- Added a 30-second `Starting` grace state to the macOS tray so routine router
  recovery does not appear as an immediate failure.
- Added the isolated Cursor target and corrected its PowerShell installer path.
- Removed the experimental Claude Desktop router target while retaining the
  direct, credential-isolated Anthropic API provider for Codex and Cursor.
- Fixed partial startup failures so already-running forwarders are terminated,
  and isolated all six ports in the real LiteLLM integration test.
- Grok OAuth account usage now reads weekly/monthly credit limits from the official Grok CLI billing endpoint.
- Rewrote routed-model catalog identity text so external models no longer
  claim to be based on GPT-5 in Codex `base_instructions`.
- Hardened local caller authentication with a separate per-install capability,
  exact internal-key checks, authenticated credential-detail health endpoints,
  browser-request rejection, and fail-closed routing before request bodies or
  provider quota are touched.
- Protected Codex config and all config snapshots for the current user, and
  redacted the caller capability from status, migration, and support output.
- Replaced raw exception text in HTTP responses and service logs with bounded,
  non-sensitive errors.
- Fixed Windows private-file ACL grants for numeric user SIDs and corrected
  router-status detection for escaped Windows catalog paths.
